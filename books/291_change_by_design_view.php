<br>The faster you fail, the sooner you succeed.

<br>Without making the brief too concrete, he helped the team establish a realistic set of goals. Without making it too broad, he left us space to interpret the concept for ourselves, to explore and to discover.
<br>
<br>Its ok to feel down -
<br>When a fresh team ventures out into the field to collect information, it is full of optimism. The process of synthesis—the ordering of data and the search for patterns—can be frustrating as important decisions seem to ride on the most insubstantial of hunches. But then things begin to pick up. The ideation process becomes more tangible, and new concepts begin to take shape. The process peaks when the team begins to produce prototypes. Even if they don’t look so good, don’t work properly, or have too many features or too few, they are visible, tangible signs of progress.

<br>Prototyping.
<br>
<br>quick and dirty
<br>Although it might seem as though frittering away valuable time on sketches and models and simulations will slow work down, prototyping generates results faster.
<br>
<br>The faster we make our ideas tangible, the sooner we will be able to evaluate them, refine them, and zero in on the best solution.
<br>
<br>Early prototypes should be fast, rough, and cheap. The greater the investment in an idea, the more committed one becomes to it.

<br>
<br>Second, the prototyping process itself creates the opportunity to discover new and better ideas at minimal cost.
<br>
<br>Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and investment as is necessary to generate useful feedback and drive an idea forward. 
<br>
<br>The greater the complexity and expense, the more “finished” it is likely to seem and the less likely its creators will be to profit from constructive feedback—or even to listen to it. 
<br>
<br>The goal of prototyping is not to create a working model. It is to give form to an idea to learn about its strengths and weaknesses and to identify new directions for the next generation of more detailed, more refined prototypes.
<br>96
<br>#
<br>
<br>The purpose of early prototypes might be to understand whether an idea has functional value. 
<br>Eventually designers need to take the prototype out into the world to get feedback from the intended users of the final product. 
<br>At this point the surface qualities of the prototype may require a bit more attention so that potential consumers are not distracted by the rough edges or unresolved details. 
<br>
<br>“Just enough prototyping” means picking what we want to learn about and achieving just enough resolution to make that the focus. An experienced prototyper knows when to say “Enough is enough.”
<br>
<br>Anything tangible that lets us explore an idea, evaluate it, and push it forward is a prototype. 
<br>
<br>Today, with sophisticated, expensive digital special effects dominating so much of Hollywood, filmmakers have moved to computer-based storyboards and “animatics” to test the motion in a shot before they commit to the real thing.
<br>
<br>Techniques borrowed from film and other creative industries suggest how we might prototype nonphysical experiences. These include scenarios, a form of storytelling in which some potential future situation or state is described using words and pictures. 
<br>#
<br>We might, for example, invent a character who fits a set of demographic factors that interest us—a divorced professional woman with two small children, for instance—and develop a believable scenario around her daily routine in order to “observe” how she might use an electric vehicle charger or an online pharmacy.
<br>
<br>The short movie followed the rounds of a fictional IT support team and was far more effective in explaining the concept to potential investors than a technical brief or a deck of PowerPoint slides. Sony used the same technique when it was developing its first online concepts in the early 1990s. A design team created scenarios around the lives of teenagers in Tokyo to show how they might use new kinds of online gaming parlors to play interactive video games or sing karaoke songs together. In the early years of the Internet these plausible fictions helped management visualize how it might become the basis of new services and business models.
<br>
<br>After spending countless days riding trains with customers, the team created a simple customer journey that described the entire travel process. The journey, for most customers, had ten steps, which included getting to the station, finding parking, buying tickets, locating the platform, and so on. The insight that proved most striking was that passengers did not take their seats on the train until stage eight—most of the experience of train travel, in other words, did not involve the train at all. The team reasoned that every one of the prior steps was an opportunity to create a positive interaction, opportunities that would have been overlooked if they had focused only on the design of the seats

<br>I have seen countless examples of good ideas that never gained traction for the simple reason of poor execution.

<br>
<br>Experiences are deeper and more meaningful. They imply active participation, not passive consumption, which can happen on many different levels

<br>Through the 1950s and ’60s, in Europe and America, local stores began to disappear, replaced by inexpensive but sterile supermarkets. The drive to lower prices—through such industrial processes as packaging, chemical preservatives, refrigeration, storage, and long-distance transport—not only removed much of the natural quality from food but also dehumanized an experience that lies close to the origins of human society. 
<br>
<br>We found that all people want to save more but only a few have strategies for doing so
<br>
<br>Rather than delivering a set of instructions created for them by a bunch of designers somewhere, we encourage them to become design thinkers themselves.
<br>-
<br>Empowering employees to seize opportunities when and where they see them and giving them the tools to create unscripted experiences is an essential element of that transformation.
<br>-
<br>What we learn from the hospitality industry, where brands are built on the delivery of great experiences, is that transforming the culture of an organization is  as important as design of interiors.
<br>
<br>Blueprint.
<br>In the days before large-format photocopy machines, never mind computer-aided design, technical drawings still needed to be reproduced for building contractors and workers on the factory floor. They used a chemical process that produced blue-lined prints with a strong smell of ammonia, and the “blueprint” became synonymous with the specifications used in manufacturing or construction

<br>
<br>design brief of the past might have called for “comfortable seating in the waiting room” or “storage unit for patient property.” The brief of the design thinkers at Nurture, by contrast, is more likely to ask, “How might we create zones of privacy in public areas?” or “How might we accommodate the different spatial requirements of patients, visitors, and medical staff in a hospital recovery room?”
<br>
<br>By shifting its focus from furniture products to the entire health care environment, Nurture represents a case study of design thinking at work. 
<br>product designers, interior designers, and architects team up with physicians, nurses, and patients to explore a problem, prototype possible solutions, and evaluate results. 
<br>Nurture begins with the premise that the physical environment contributes to the healing process as much as do prescription medicines, surgical instruments, and a skilled nursing staff.

<br>They liked the fish. Next time give them the net.” The deliverable, in other words, was great, but Liang saw the opportunity to share with Acer the process that had created it.

<br>If it does a better job of understanding its customers, it will do a better job of satisfying their needs. That is simply the most reliable source of long-term profitability and sustainable growth.

<br>
<br>As consumers we are making new and different sorts of demands; we relate differently to brands; we expect to participate in determining what will be offered to us; and we expect our relationship with manufacturers and sellers to continue beyond the point of purchase. To meet these heightened expectations, companies have to yield some of their sovereign authority over the market and enter into a two-way conversation with their customers.
