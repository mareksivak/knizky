<br>You might dream of the largest worm farm
<br>If Gandhi knew you, he would say - at first they laugh at you,... To motivate you to become the largest worm seller in the world 
<br>
<br>Figuring out ways of making money meant later on in life I would have the freedom to do whatever I wanted. The idea of one day running my own company also meant that I could be creative and eventually live life on my own terms.
<br>
<br>We were part of a secret club, and the first rule of computer-lab-lunch club was that you did not talk about computer-lab-lunch club. Nobody had any clue what we were up to.
<br>
<br>Controlling the game - bending the norms
<br>-
<br>Had a job.
<br>I started making deals with my teachers in which they agreed to let me not attend their classes as long as I did well on their tests.
<br>-
<br>Homework
<br>Needed to write a sonnet like Shakespeare
<br>Always looked for creative ways around actually doimg any hard work
<br>It all seemed way too complicated for me, so I decided to just submit fourteen lines of Morse code instead, where the entire poem was nothing but alternating dots and dashes. Depending on the teacher’s mood, I knew I was either going to get an A or an F. Luckily, my teacher decided to give me an “A+++++++++++.” 
<br>I think that’s when I learned that, even in school, it sometimes pays to take risks and think outside the box.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Accused of stealing a lunch card.
<br>I told the truth but no body believed me. I got suspended for a day.
<br>I walked away from that experience with the lesson that sometimes the truth alone isn’t enough, and that presentation of the truth was just as important as the truth. 
<br>#
<br>
<br>Besides school I focused on how to make more money
<br>
<br>Made a prank on boss
<br>I don’t think any of us had laughed that hard in a long time, and it was great to see how having a little fun in the office could lighten everyone’s mood.
<br>
<br>I learned a valuable lesson in humility. And somewhat ironically, I’d just learned the term hubris in my Greek history class, which was defined as “an exaggerated sense of pride or self-confidence,” and it caused the downfall of many a Greek hero.
<br>
<br>Uni - Brown - offered advertising major which I was the most relevant to the business world
<br>
<br>Snoozed alarm at 8am
<br>If I could skip the first class of the day and get the notes from someone else later. Then, an hour later, I would convince myself that since that logic worked so well for the first class, I could apply it to the second class, so I missed that class as well. By the time I was supposed to be getting ready to go to my third class, I reasoned that I had already skipped two classes, so one more class really wasn’t that big a deal. And finally, by the time I was supposed to be headed to my last class of the day, I figured there was no point in only attending one class when I had skipped all the others. The incremental benefit from getting up just to go to that one class just didn’t seem worth it.
<br>
<br>There was an inseparable group who lived in the same dorm. Most of us never made any friends outside group and we stocked together during all 4 years
<br>
<br>Harvard final exams. Couldn't get prepared on a list of 100 topics
<br>Necessity is a mother of invention
<br>Started a virtual study class - each student had to email me paragraphs for 3 topics as they given on exam
<br>You had to pay 20 and I will photocopy and send you a list of 100 and you could buy binder only if you contributed by 3 topics to the project
<br>-without opening g a book I ended up with the most comprehensive study guide
<br>-i had also discovered a power of crowdsourcing
<br>#
<br>€€think of his empathy in selling the project
<br>Need to put his interest over his owm
<br>
<br>I had never made a successful sales call before, but I knew my mission was to convince them that they needed a Web site and that we were the right partners for them.
<br>
<br>I also decided that I would wait until tomorrow to resign. Clearly I was being given signs that today was not the right day.
<br>
<br>Resignation - tell you have a better offer.
<br>Whatever real reason is
<br>"Wow, you must be joining a startup!"
<br>
<br>At the rate we were going, we would actually be making a lot less money than we were at Oracle.
<br>But we wanted to run our own business and be in control of our own destiny. This wasn’t about the money, it was about not being bored.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We didn’t know what we wanted to do, but we had learned what we didn’t want to do. We didn’t want to work for Oracle. We didn’t want to do any more Web design work. We didn’t want to make any more sales calls. And we didn’t want to be bored out of our minds.
<br>
<br>Link Exchange
<br>-built over weekend, to our surprise more than half of the websites we emailed signed up.
<br>As people saw our banners on web we knew our project that was initially meant to fight boredom had potential to turn into something big
<br>
<br>-we were not worried about money
<br>-we were focused on growing network - to become more valuablr
<br>
<br>Half day programming, half day customer support
<br>We were religious about trying to answer every e-mail that came in as quickly as possible. Usually we were able to answer them within ten minutes, and people were amazed at our responsiveness.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Got an offer for 1 million after 5 months
<br>We really believed that LinkExchange had the potential to be so much bigger, but it was also hard to turn down so much money. So we decided to tell Lenny that we would sell the company for $2 million cash. This way, Sanjay and I would be able to walk away with $1 million each after only five months of work. I had read somewhere that you’re in your best negotiating position if you don’t care what the outcome is and you’re not afraid to walk away. At $2 million, I would be happy whether the deal happened or not. 
<br>As it turned out, Lenny didn’t think we were worth $2 million
<br>
<br>
<br>Back in college, I’d learned that Hadi was interested in magic, so we had briefly discussed the idea of putting on a magic show in the college amphitheater as a way of possibly earning some extra cash.
<br>--
<br>When I contacted Hadi, I asked him if he’d be interested in joining LinkExchange, and I gave him all the background information about how quickly we were growing, the $1 million offer we had just turned down, and how exciting everything was.
<br>#
<br>
<br>“Twenty million dollars.” I tried my hardest not to flinch and to appear as calm as possible.
<br>“We’ve decided to turn down their offer.”
<br>
<br>Culture - not recognizing faves because of rapid growth - warning sign
<br>During the first year, we’d hired our friends and people who wanted to be part of building something fun and exciting. Without realizing it, we had together created a company culture that we all enjoyed being a part of.
<br>
<br>How did we go from an “all-for-one, one-for-all” team environment to one that was now all about politics, positioning, and rumors?
<br>
<br>We told them that the price tag was going to be at least $250 million. I’m not sure how we came up with that number, but it sounded good to me, and I guess it was a good sign that Netscape and Microsoft both said they wanted to continue talking.
<br>
<br>Poker
<br>You are playing against other players, not casino. As long as you are better than average player you can win in the long run
<br>
<br>I made a list of happiest periods in my life and none of them involved money
<br>I realised building stuff, being creative and inventive made me happy.
<br>#
<br>
<br>I thought about how easily we are all brainwashed by our society and culture to stop thinking and just assume by default that more money equals more success and more happiness, when ultimately happiness is really just about enjoying life.
<br>
<br>I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion.
<br>
<br>ZAPPOS
<br>Started venture fond - shoesite.com - 
<br>Ideas of Amazon for shoes, build the largest store for shoes online.
<br>One of those bad internet ideas - companies trying to sell pet food or furniture online, losing a lot of money in the process
<br>Game me numbers before mescraping his intro - shoe market is 40B, 5 percent was alreadt´y ordered through paper catalogs
<br>-
<br>It didn't matter whether I wanted to buy shoes without trying them first. What mattered was that customers were already doing it and it seemed reasonable that web can become a big catalog one day.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We didn’t pretend we had a real office, and Nick didn’t pretend he had much more than an idea, but it was clear that he was passionate about the opportunity. 
<br>
<br>I remember buying shoes was hard, couldn't get right shoes, store after store, mall after mall. Could imagine problems people living in small towns had.
<br>That time there were some mom and pops stores online, but they didn't make shopping easier. I thought, what if there was a simple place online, where people can pick the right shoes they want, choose the right size and in a few days if´t will be delivered to their doorstep to try. Simple idea, but why wasn't anybody doing it?
<br>##
<br>
<br>Reason - some industry was fragmented and not tech savvy. If I could create a network between stores it could be a solution
<br>I went to local stores took pictures two their stock and put it on the website. Everytime when someone bought shoes i would buy in the store and ship it to them.
<br>The most primitive use of technology and it worked.
<br>###
<br>
<br>I never bought a pair through mail order, statistics showed there was a plenty of people doing it.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Selling 2000 per month, not making any profit, doing that to prove people would buy online
<br>Idea: get inventories of hundreds of brands online. Zappos would take orders and transmit to manufacturer for shipping
<br>Zappos wouldn't have to run own inventory or have a warehouse
<br>
<br>Nick and Fred were exactly the type of people we were looking to invest in. We didn’t know if the shoe idea would work or not, but they were clearly passionate and willing to place big bets.
<br>
<br>We were pioneering a new concept of having brands drop ship directly from their inventory to customer
<br>##
<br>Manufacturer value prop
<br>
<br>Talking to the brands was actually educational because they asked legitimate questions like, “How are you going to ship it? Who’s your shipping carrier? How do you plan to handle returns?”
<br>
<br>Lot of growth happens that way - throw ideas against tje wall and of they stick, improvise and make them happen
<br>(Cold calling, pitches, find partners who believe in you)
<br>
<br>As investors we invested in 27 companies and once in 2 Weekes we checked on their progress.
<br>It was strange to me to not being involved in day-to-day details
<br>
<br>Poker
<br>-seems mostly about luck
<br>-for each round there is matheˇatically correct way of playing (ratios among the amount of bet, number of chips in pot, statistical chances of winning)
<br>-players who play correctly will end up winning on long term
<br>--
<br>-need to learn discipline not to confuse right decision with a quick win / individual outcome
<br>--eg, flipping coin, lands on heads a third of time. seeing coin landing on head and changing behavior is a quick win, because correct way is to get on tail no matter what happened in previous flip
<br>
<br>Same with business-Separate focus on short term thinking (win individual game) and long term thinking (making sure you have the right decision strategy)
<br>
<br>Lessons from poker to business
<br>
<br>Evaluating Market Opportunities 
<br>Table selection is the most important decision you can make. 
<br>*It’s okay to switch tables if you discover it’s too hard to win at your table*. 
<br>If there are too many competitors (some irrational or inexperienced), even if you’re the best it’s a lot harder to win. 
<br>
<br>Marketing and Branding 
<br>*Act weak when strong, act strong when weak.* Know when to bluff. 
<br>Your “brand” is important. 
<br>Help shape the stories that people are telling about you.
<br>
<br>Financials 
<br>Always be prepared for the worst possible scenario. 
<br>*The guy who wins the most hands is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run.* 
<br>The guy who never loses a hand is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run. 
<br>*Go for positive expected value, not what’s least risky.* 
<br>Make sure your bankroll is large enough for the game you’re playing and the risks you’re taking. 
<br>Play only with what you can afford to lose.
<br> *Remember that it’s a long-term game*. You will win or lose individual hands or sessions, but it’s what happens in the long term that matters.
<br>
<br>Strategy 
<br>Don’t play games that you don’t understand, even if you see lots of other people making money from them. 
<br>*Figure out the game when the stakes aren’t high.* 
<br>Don’t cheat. *Cheaters never win in the long run.* 
<br>*Stick to your principles.* 
<br>You need to adjust your style of play throughout the night as the dynamics of the game change. Be flexible. Be patient and think long-term. The players with the most stamina and focus usually win. 
<br>Differentiate yourself. *Do the opposite of what the rest of the table is doing.* 
<br>Hope is not a good plan. 
<br>Don’t let yourself go “on tilt.” It’s much more cost-effective to *take a break, walk around, or leave the game for the night*. 
<br>
<br>Continual Learning 
<br>Educate yourself. Read books and learn from others who have done it before. Learn by doing. Theory is nice, but nothing replaces actual experience. 
<br>Learn by surrounding yourself with talented players. *Just because you win a hand doesn’t mean you’re good and you don’t have more learning to do*. 
<br>You might have just gotten lucky. Don’t be afraid to ask for advice. 
<br>
<br>Culture 
<br>You’ve gotta love the game. To *become really good, you need to live it and sleep it.*
<br>Be nice and make friends. *It’s a small community.* 
<br>*Share what you’ve learned with others.*
<br>
<br>Game starts when you choose table.
<br>Sit with players who are tired and have a lot of chips.
<br>Dont sit with guys who are focused and little chips.
<br>--
<br>it doesn't matter how flawlessly your business is executed, when it's wrong business or if it's in too small market
<br>##
<br>You cannot get far if you sell the best 7fingered gloves or compete with experiences competitors such as Walmart playing their game - selling same products for cheap prices
<br>
<br>You can create your table and make it bigger.
<br>When Southwest started, thy didn't see their market only in airline travellers which was what all the other airlines did.
<br>They saw their service as something that could potentially serve coach and train travellers and they built their service around that - offered short flights at cheap prices. They succeeded because they played different game than other airlines
<br>#
<br>
<br>I realised in everything I was doing it was easy to get caught up - business, life. To forget there is option to change poker table. It's psychologically hard to overcome all interia (zotrvačnosť)
<br>*Without conscious effort interia always wins*
<br>#
<br>
<br>I’d started to force myself to think again about what I was trying to get out of life. I asked myself what I was trying to accomplish, what I wanted to do, and whether I should be sitting at a different table.
<br>
<br>I realised once I learned poker I wasn't building anything by spending hours at casinos. I needed to do something fulfilling, it was time to move on
<br>
<br>Investing, trading, stocks
<br>They were expensive lessons, but I guess what I ended up learning was that it’s a bad idea to invest in industries you don’t understand, in companies you don’t have any control or influence over, or in people you don’t know or trust.
<br>
<br>Sequoia denied to invest. We reached out to find out what happened if anything had happened wrong
<br>All impressive given small size.they wanted to see more growth and progress and suggested to touch base in few months
<br>
<br>Letting Zappos go out of business would have fit in better with our original investment strategy and philosophy:
<br>
<br>But I like the guys, they are passionate and determined, not interested to get rich quick. Want to build something for the long term
<br>-well then we should invest more money and spend more time to protect the investment
<br>
<br>I guess at the end of the day, my thought is that it’s pretty hard to find a good companion that’s compatible with so many parts of your life and is always there to support you along the way. 
<br>-
<br>I think it's a relationship worth keeping
<br>#
<br>
<br>I made a note to myself to make sure I never lost sight of the value of a tribe where people truly felt connected and cared about the well-being of one another.
<br>
<br>Research: combination of physical synchrony with other humans and being part of something bigger than oneself (thus losing a sense of self) leads to greater sense of happiness
<br>-techno dance rooms. Techno music - cannot be listened like music from radio. You have to let it flow through you
<br>#
<br>
<br>Rave values - peace love unity respect
<br>To me it was a philosophy about being open to meeting people no matter how they looked or their backgrounds were
<br>Every interaction is a new opportunity to gain a new perspective
<br>And it learns you to start conversations with strangers
<br>
<br>Build genuine friendships instead of business networking
<br>-build relationships know people as people, in their human core. There is *something interesting about anyone*. Figure that out. find their perspectives
<br>-*turning points in your life will be pure luck but will come from these* relationships
<br>-never use business card
<br>-goal should be to build relationship, not to get benefit from it. Getting to know someone on personal level starts after 2-3 years of building relationship
<br>Maybe someone who you met on tennis is a perfect candidate for your role, or your neighbor was hired as VP.
<br>##
<br>
<br>I made a mental note to...
<br>
<br>“Envision, create, and believe in your own universe, and the universe will form around you,”
<br>Just like what you did
<br>##
<br>What pieces are necessary?
<br>-
<br>I wanted to create something and creating an incubator was an important piece to building my own universe
<br>
<br>It turns out venture investing is a lot like poker. The one who makes the most money isn’t the one who tries to play and win as many hands as possible.
<br>
<br>I had discovered my new passion. I was passionate about proving everyone wrong.
<br>
<br>You can't stop waves but you can learn to surf
<br>#
<br>Be humble: in beginners mind, there are thousands opportunities, in experts only few
<br>
<br>"On positive side, we don't need to worry about well funded competitor confusing marketplace and giving us a lot of short term headaches"
<br>
<br>Layoff
<br>Everyone remaining worked even harder. We were surprised to find that it didn't hurt company's productivity. We laid off underperformers and non-believers, everyone remaining was so passionate we could accomplish as much work as we had before.
<br>#
<br>Lesson to work as unified team. Everybody makes sacrifices
<br>
<br>We cut off most of our marketing expenses and refocused efforts on customers who bought from us before to purchase again and more frequently.
<br>This was blessing
<br>It forces us to focus on delivering the best customer experience
<br>Customer experiemce became focus re the company.
