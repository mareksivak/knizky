<br>You might dream of the largest worm farm
<br>If Gandhi knew you, he would say - at first they laugh at you,... To motivate you to become the largest worm seller in the world 
<br>
<br>Figuring out ways of making money meant later on in life I would have the freedom to do whatever I wanted. The idea of one day running my own company also meant that I could be creative and eventually live life on my own terms.
<br>
<br>We were part of a secret club, and the first rule of computer-lab-lunch club was that you did not talk about computer-lab-lunch club. Nobody had any clue what we were up to.
<br>
<br>Controlling the game - bending the norms
<br>-
<br>Had a job.
<br>I started making deals with my teachers in which they agreed to let me not attend their classes as long as I did well on their tests.
<br>-
<br>Homework
<br>Needed to write a sonnet like Shakespeare
<br>Always looked for creative ways around actually doimg any hard work
<br>It all seemed way too complicated for me, so I decided to just submit fourteen lines of Morse code instead, where the entire poem was nothing but alternating dots and dashes. Depending on the teacher’s mood, I knew I was either going to get an A or an F. Luckily, my teacher decided to give me an “A+++++++++++.” 
<br>I think that’s when I learned that, even in school, it sometimes pays to take risks and think outside the box.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Accused of stealing a lunch card.
<br>I told the truth but no body believed me. I got suspended for a day.
<br>I walked away from that experience with the lesson that sometimes the truth alone isn’t enough, and that presentation of the truth was just as important as the truth. 
<br>#
<br>
<br>Besides school I focused on how to make more money
<br>
<br>Made a prank on boss
<br>I don’t think any of us had laughed that hard in a long time, and it was great to see how having a little fun in the office could lighten everyone’s mood.
<br>
<br>I learned a valuable lesson in humility. And somewhat ironically, I’d just learned the term hubris in my Greek history class, which was defined as “an exaggerated sense of pride or self-confidence,” and it caused the downfall of many a Greek hero.
<br>
<br>Uni - Brown - offered advertising major which I was the most relevant to the business world
<br>
<br>Snoozed alarm at 8am
<br>If I could skip the first class of the day and get the notes from someone else later. Then, an hour later, I would convince myself that since that logic worked so well for the first class, I could apply it to the second class, so I missed that class as well. By the time I was supposed to be getting ready to go to my third class, I reasoned that I had already skipped two classes, so one more class really wasn’t that big a deal. And finally, by the time I was supposed to be headed to my last class of the day, I figured there was no point in only attending one class when I had skipped all the others. The incremental benefit from getting up just to go to that one class just didn’t seem worth it.
<br>
<br>There was an inseparable group who lived in the same dorm. Most of us never made any friends outside group and we stocked together during all 4 years
<br>
<br>Harvard final exams. Couldn't get prepared on a list of 100 topics
<br>Necessity is a mother of invention
<br>Started a virtual study class - each student had to email me paragraphs for 3 topics as they given on exam
<br>You had to pay 20 and I will photocopy and send you a list of 100 and you could buy binder only if you contributed by 3 topics to the project
<br>-without opening g a book I ended up with the most comprehensive study guide
<br>-i had also discovered a power of crowdsourcing
<br>#
<br>€€think of his empathy in selling the project
<br>Need to put his interest over his owm
<br>
<br>I had never made a successful sales call before, but I knew my mission was to convince them that they needed a Web site and that we were the right partners for them.
<br>
<br>I also decided that I would wait until tomorrow to resign. Clearly I was being given signs that today was not the right day.
<br>
<br>Resignation - tell you have a better offer.
<br>Whatever real reason is
<br>"Wow, you must be joining a startup!"
<br>
<br>At the rate we were going, we would actually be making a lot less money than we were at Oracle.
<br>But we wanted to run our own business and be in control of our own destiny. This wasn’t about the money, it was about not being bored.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We didn’t know what we wanted to do, but we had learned what we didn’t want to do. We didn’t want to work for Oracle. We didn’t want to do any more Web design work. We didn’t want to make any more sales calls. And we didn’t want to be bored out of our minds.
<br>
<br>Link Exchange
<br>-built over weekend, to our surprise more than half of the websites we emailed signed up.
<br>As people saw our banners on web we knew our project that was initially meant to fight boredom had potential to turn into something big
<br>
<br>-we were not worried about money
<br>-we were focused on growing network - to become more valuablr
<br>
<br>Half day programming, half day customer support
<br>We were religious about trying to answer every e-mail that came in as quickly as possible. Usually we were able to answer them within ten minutes, and people were amazed at our responsiveness.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Got an offer for 1 million after 5 months
<br>We really believed that LinkExchange had the potential to be so much bigger, but it was also hard to turn down so much money. So we decided to tell Lenny that we would sell the company for $2 million cash. This way, Sanjay and I would be able to walk away with $1 million each after only five months of work. I had read somewhere that you’re in your best negotiating position if you don’t care what the outcome is and you’re not afraid to walk away. At $2 million, I would be happy whether the deal happened or not. 
<br>As it turned out, Lenny didn’t think we were worth $2 million
<br>
<br>
<br>Back in college, I’d learned that Hadi was interested in magic, so we had briefly discussed the idea of putting on a magic show in the college amphitheater as a way of possibly earning some extra cash.
<br>--
<br>When I contacted Hadi, I asked him if he’d be interested in joining LinkExchange, and I gave him all the background information about how quickly we were growing, the $1 million offer we had just turned down, and how exciting everything was.
<br>#
<br>
<br>“Twenty million dollars.” I tried my hardest not to flinch and to appear as calm as possible.
<br>“We’ve decided to turn down their offer.”
<br>
<br>Culture - not recognizing faves because of rapid growth - warning sign
<br>During the first year, we’d hired our friends and people who wanted to be part of building something fun and exciting. Without realizing it, we had together created a company culture that we all enjoyed being a part of.
<br>
<br>How did we go from an “all-for-one, one-for-all” team environment to one that was now all about politics, positioning, and rumors?
<br>
<br>We told them that the price tag was going to be at least $250 million. I’m not sure how we came up with that number, but it sounded good to me, and I guess it was a good sign that Netscape and Microsoft both said they wanted to continue talking.
<br>
<br>Poker
<br>You are playing against other players, not casino. As long as you are better than average player you can win in the long run
<br>
<br>I made a list of happiest periods in my life and none of them involved money
<br>I realised building stuff, being creative and inventive made me happy.
<br>#
<br>
<br>I thought about how easily we are all brainwashed by our society and culture to stop thinking and just assume by default that more money equals more success and more happiness, when ultimately happiness is really just about enjoying life.
<br>
<br>I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion.
<br>
<br>ZAPPOS
<br>Started venture fond - shoesite.com - 
<br>Ideas of Amazon for shoes, build the largest store for shoes online.
<br>One of those bad internet ideas - companies trying to sell pet food or furniture online, losing a lot of money in the process
<br>Game me numbers before mescraping his intro - shoe market is 40B, 5 percent was alreadt´y ordered through paper catalogs
<br>-
<br>It didn't matter whether I wanted to buy shoes without trying them first. What mattered was that customers were already doing it and it seemed reasonable that web can become a big catalog one day.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We didn’t pretend we had a real office, and Nick didn’t pretend he had much more than an idea, but it was clear that he was passionate about the opportunity. 
<br>
<br>I remember buying shoes was hard, couldn't get right shoes, store after store, mall after mall. Could imagine problems people living in small towns had.
<br>That time there were some mom and pops stores online, but they didn't make shopping easier. I thought, what if there was a simple place online, where people can pick the right shoes they want, choose the right size and in a few days if´t will be delivered to their doorstep to try. Simple idea, but why wasn't anybody doing it?
<br>##
<br>
<br>Reason - some industry was fragmented and not tech savvy. If I could create a network between stores it could be a solution
<br>I went to local stores took pictures two their stock and put it on the website. Everytime when someone bought shoes i would buy in the store and ship it to them.
<br>The most primitive use of technology and it worked.
<br>###
<br>
<br>I never bought a pair through mail order, statistics showed there was a plenty of people doing it.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Selling 2000 per month, not making any profit, doing that to prove people would buy online
<br>Idea: get inventories of hundreds of brands online. Zappos would take orders and transmit to manufacturer for shipping
<br>Zappos wouldn't have to run own inventory or have a warehouse
<br>
<br>Nick and Fred were exactly the type of people we were looking to invest in. We didn’t know if the shoe idea would work or not, but they were clearly passionate and willing to place big bets.
<br>
<br>We were pioneering a new concept of having brands drop ship directly from their inventory to customer
<br>##
<br>Manufacturer value prop
<br>
<br>Talking to the brands was actually educational because they asked legitimate questions like, “How are you going to ship it? Who’s your shipping carrier? How do you plan to handle returns?”
<br>
<br>Lot of growth happens that way - throw ideas against tje wall and of they stick, improvise and make them happen
<br>(Cold calling, pitches, find partners who believe in you)
<br>
<br>As investors we invested in 27 companies and once in 2 Weekes we checked on their progress.
<br>It was strange to me to not being involved in day-to-day details
<br>
<br>Poker
<br>-seems mostly about luck
<br>-for each round there is matheˇatically correct way of playing (ratios among the amount of bet, number of chips in pot, statistical chances of winning)
<br>-players who play correctly will end up winning on long term
<br>--
<br>-need to learn discipline not to confuse right decision with a quick win / individual outcome
<br>--eg, flipping coin, lands on heads a third of time. seeing coin landing on head and changing behavior is a quick win, because correct way is to get on tail no matter what happened in previous flip
<br>
<br>Same with business-Separate focus on short term thinking (win individual game) and long term thinking (making sure you have the right decision strategy)
<br>
<br>Lessons from poker to business
<br>
<br>Evaluating Market Opportunities 
<br>Table selection is the most important decision you can make. 
<br><strong>It’s okay to switch tables if you discover it’s too hard to win at your table</strong>. 
<br>If there are too many competitors (some irrational or inexperienced), even if you’re the best it’s a lot harder to win. 
<br>
<br>Marketing and Branding 
<br><strong>Act weak when strong, act strong when weak.</strong> Know when to bluff. 
<br>Your “brand” is important. 
<br>Help shape the stories that people are telling about you.
<br>
<br>Financials 
<br>Always be prepared for the worst possible scenario. 
<br>*The guy who wins the most hands is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run.* 
<br>The guy who never loses a hand is not the guy who makes the most money in the long run. 
<br>*Go for positive expected value, not what’s least risky.* 
<br>Make sure your bankroll is large enough for the game you’re playing and the risks you’re taking. 
<br>Play only with what you can afford to lose.
<br><strong>Remember that it’s a long-term game</strong>. You will win or lose individual hands or sessions, but it’s what happens in the long term that matters.
<br>
<br>Strategy 
<br>Don’t play games that you don’t understand, even if you see lots of other people making money from them. 
<br><strong>Figure out the game when the stakes aren’t high.</strong> 
<br>Don’t cheat. *Cheaters never win in the long run.* 
<br><strong>Stick to your principles.</strong>
<br>You need to adjust your style of play throughout the night as the dynamics of the game change. Be flexible. Be patient and think long-term. The players with the most stamina and focus usually win. 
<br>Differentiate yourself. <strong>Do the opposite of what the rest of the table is doing.</strong>
<br>Hope is not a good plan. 
<br>Don’t let yourself go “on tilt.” It’s much more cost-effective to *take a break, walk around, or leave the game for the night*. 
<br>
<br>Continual Learning 
<br>Educate yourself. Read books and learn from others who have done it before. Learn by doing. Theory is nice, but nothing replaces actual experience. 
<br>Learn by surrounding yourself with talented players. *Just because you win a hand doesn’t mean you’re good and you don’t have more learning to do*. 
<br>You might have just gotten lucky. Don’t be afraid to ask for advice. 
<br>
<br>Culture 
<br>You’ve gotta love the game. To <strong>become really good, you need to live it and sleep it.</strong>
<br>Be nice and make friends. *It’s a small community.* 
<br>*Share what you’ve learned with others.*
<br>
<br>Game starts when you choose table.
<br>Sit with players who are tired and have a lot of chips.
<br>Dont sit with guys who are focused and little chips.
<br>--
<br>it doesn't matter how flawlessly your business is executed, when it's wrong business or if it's in too small market
<br>##
<br>You cannot get far if you sell the best 7fingered gloves or compete with experiences competitors such as Walmart playing their game - selling same products for cheap prices
<br>
<br>You can create your table and make it bigger.
<br>When Southwest started, thy didn't see their market only in airline travellers which was what all the other airlines did.
<br>They saw their service as something that could potentially serve coach and train travellers and they built their service around that - offered short flights at cheap prices. They succeeded because they played different game than other airlines
<br>#
<br>
<br>I realised in everything I was doing it was easy to get caught up - business, life. To forget there is option to change poker table. It's psychologically hard to overcome all interia (zotrvačnosť)
<br><strong>Without conscious effort interia always wins</strong>
<br>#
<br>
<br>I’d started to force myself to think again about what I was trying to get out of life. I asked myself what I was trying to accomplish, what I wanted to do, and whether I should be sitting at a different table.
<br>
<br>I realised once I learned poker I wasn't building anything by spending hours at casinos. I needed to do something fulfilling, it was time to move on
<br>
<br>Investing, trading, stocks
<br>They were expensive lessons, but I guess what I ended up learning was that it’s a bad idea to invest in industries you don’t understand, in companies you don’t have any control or influence over, or in people you don’t know or trust.
<br>
<br>Sequoia denied to invest. We reached out to find out what happened if anything had happened wrong
<br>All impressive given small size.they wanted to see more growth and progress and suggested to touch base in few months
<br>
<br>Letting Zappos go out of business would have fit in better with our original investment strategy and philosophy:
<br>
<br>But I like the guys, they are passionate and determined, not interested to get rich quick. Want to build something for the long term
<br>-well then we should invest more money and spend more time to protect the investment
<br>
<br>I guess at the end of the day, my thought is that it’s pretty hard to find a good companion that’s compatible with so many parts of your life and is always there to support you along the way. 
<br>-
<br>I think it's a relationship worth keeping
<br>#
<br>
<br>I made a note to myself to make sure I never lost sight of the value of a tribe where people truly felt connected and cared about the well-being of one another.
<br>
<br>Research: combination of physical synchrony with other humans and being part of something bigger than oneself (thus losing a sense of self) leads to greater sense of happiness
<br>-techno dance rooms. Techno music - cannot be listened like music from radio. You have to let it flow through you
<br>#
<br>
<br>Rave values - peace love unity respect
<br>To me it was a philosophy about being open to meeting people no matter how they looked or their backgrounds were
<br>Every interaction is a new opportunity to gain a new perspective
<br>And it learns you to start conversations with strangers
<br>
<br>Build genuine friendships instead of business networking
<br>-build relationships know people as people, in their human core. There is *something interesting about anyone*. Figure that out. find their perspectives
<br>-<strong>turning points in your life will be pure luck but will come from these</strong> relationships
<br>-never use business card
<br>-goal should be to build relationship, not to get benefit from it. Getting to know someone on personal level starts after 2-3 years of building relationship
<br>Maybe someone who you met on tennis is a perfect candidate for your role, or your neighbor was hired as VP.
<br>##
<br>
<br>I made a mental note to...
<br>
<br>“Envision, create, and believe in your own universe, and the universe will form around you,”
<br>Just like what you did
<br>##
<br>What pieces are necessary?
<br>-
<br>I wanted to create something and creating an incubator was an important piece to building my own universe
<br>
<br>It turns out venture investing is a lot like poker. The one who makes the most money isn’t the one who tries to play and win as many hands as possible.
<br>
<br>I had discovered my new passion. I was passionate about proving everyone wrong.
<br>
<br>You can't stop waves but you can learn to surf
<br>#
<br>Be humble: in beginners mind, there are thousands opportunities, in experts only few
<br>
<br>"On positive side, we don't need to worry about well funded competitor confusing marketplace and giving us a lot of short term headaches"
<br>
<br>Layoff
<br>Everyone remaining worked even harder. We were surprised to find that it didn't hurt company's productivity. We laid off underperformers and non-believers, everyone remaining was so passionate we could accomplish as much work as we had before.
<br>#
<br>Lesson to work as unified team. Everybody makes sacrifices
<br>
<br>We cut off most of our marketing expenses and refocused efforts on customers who bought from us before to purchase again and more frequently.
<br>This was blessing
<br>It forces us to focus on delivering the best customer experience
<br>Customer experience became focus re the company.
<br>##
<br>




<br>I broke the ice
<br><strong>"So.. any ideas to increase sales more quickly?"</strong>
<br>-I like to say we need right product at the right time and sales will take care of themselves. Problem is we don't have brands we can sell
<br>-How do we get the right products?
<br>-Brands we want don't drop ship - don't dˇfit to our business model. They supply brick and mortar stores, they warehouses don't ship directly
<br>--why do brick and mortar stores have the best brands?
<br>-because they own inventory. Retailer takes inventory risk - if can't sell, their problem not wholesaler's.
<br>::Figure out what need. List of items
<br>-hire a team to manage inventory. Fred can do on short term
<br>-we need to convince brands to sell us. Brands we want would sell only to brick and mortars. We need brick and mortar store. Use office for short term
<br>-update website to sell inventories goods
<br>-need a warehouse to store goods. Use office on short term.
<br>-need 2M cash for inventory
<br>##
<br>--
<br>"I will take care of that. Just assume re err can convince brands we signuo, you will have cash for inventory"
<br>--
<br>I had no idea how Fred was going to convince brands to work with us on such a short time and Fred had no idea how I was going to come up with cash for inventory
<br>But we trusted each other and we knew we are in this together
<br>#
<br>
<br>Drop-ship-only model was to die slowly - only delaying the imevitable
<br>
<br>Fred was right, sales tripled. Everyone was excited about new business model which combined drop shipping and inventoried products.
<br>But we stillwerent cashflow-positive
<br>
<br>The faster shipping would be a way to WOW customers through better service
<br>
<br>“Are you sure you want to do that?” Fred gulped. “You’re going to take a huge loss on that. I feel bad.”
<br>-<strong>Yeah but it will be worth on the long run</strong>
<br>
<br>I started trying to play mind games with myself. I knew the entire hike would take about six hours, but I had no concept of how much time had passed. I imagined that I was driving from my home in San Francisco down to my friend’s house in Palo Alto, which was a forty-five-minute drive I had made many times. I imagined the landmarks and highway exits along the way, and started counting my steps. I visualized in my head the progress I was making toward Palo Alto. Once I eventually made it to Palo Alto, I would turn around and drive back up to San Francisco in my head.
<br>-
<br>I started thinking about how much more I should appreciate the things I had. I imagined what a nice, warm hot shower would feel like. I thought about what eating at Mel’s Diner would be like. I imagined how delicious a turkey melt would be, dipped in chicken noodle soup. I made a mental note and promised myself that I would order that as my first meal when I got back home.
<br>
<br>We knew we need to run and control our warehouse.
<br>We cannot rely on 3rd party to take care of our customers
<br>-high risk: 3rd provider and incentives to provide best service
<br>##
<br>Never outsource your core competency
<br>###
<br>
<br>As e-commerce, warehousing is your core competency.
<br>Trusting that come one also would care about your customers as much as you is a mistake.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Asking for 6million loan.
<br>Never did such thing but could sense the passion we had for business and were impressed with our growth rate
<br>
<br>..all assuming keeping careful spending money
<br>There are plenty of companies in better position than us, now out of business, because they became overconfident, careless, celebrating past successes instead of carefully navigating to the future
<br>
<br>Continue becoming leader in that space because of relentless focus on improving customer experience
<br>Virgin - I saw them as cool and hip brand
<br>
<br>We have done revolutionary things that customers love
<br>-best shoe selection online and offline
<br>-free shipping and returns for all customers
<br>-although promise to receive in 4-5 days, we upgrade almost all customers
<br>Not something that we have to do, not something that increase profit on short term
<br>#
<br>but that's something that creates great customer experience, we chose to do it, because on long run, little things that keepthe customer in mind will pay huge dividends
<br>##
<br>
<br>TH - planning parties - always enjoyed creating wow moment when people arrived 
<br>
<br>When you don't need to worry about survival - you start about building something great on long term
<br>#
<br>
<br>Customer Service
<br>-we saw people saw it as temporary job
<br>-culture: working in call center is not what people want to do
<br>
<br>To build the Zappos brand into being about the very best customer service, we needed to make sure customer service was the entire company, not just a department. 
<br>###
<br>We needed to move our entire headquarters from San Francisco to wherever we wanted to build out our call center, which we had recently named our Customer Loyalty Team (or just CLT).
<br>
<br>Moving HQ to Las Vegas.
<br>70 out of 90 employees willing to take a shot
<br>In their minds, it was all about being adventurous and open-minded.
<br>
<br>After initial shock...
<br>I started feeling different. Why not?...
<br>
<br>Culture is the most important - mistake linkexchange when culture went downhill
<br>
<br>Get culture right, building brand will go naturally on its own
<br>
<br>To keep culture strong, we hired only people who we would enjoy hanging out with outside the office
<br>#
<br>Many great ideas came while having drinks
<br>
<br>I asked each new hire to talk about culture
<br>Everyone gave own interpretation
<br>-
<br>Resulted in Culture book
<br>Freely express thoughts on culture (what it is like? What's different Compared to other employees? What do you like?)
<br>Except correcting typos, leave it unedited and publish for new hires
<br>100-500 words
<br>#
<br>
<br>Give evangelists a voice
<br>Try the same with customers 
<br>
<br>3 key areas to invest resources
<br>Customer service (build brand, drive word of mouth)
<br>Culture (form core values)
<br>Employee training and development
<br>-competitive advantages we have in long run. Everything else can be copied
<br>
<br>Put money where it matters the most
<br>Take risks on ideas before they are proven
<br>Shirt term expense, long term investment
<br>
<br>CUSTOMER CENTRICITY
<br>
<br>Our philosophy has been to take most of the money we would have spent on paid advertising and invest it into customer service and the customer experience instead, letting our customers do the marketing for us through word of mouth.
<br>##
<br>
<br>What is customer centricity?
<br>Starts with customers first
<br>Making transactions as easy as possible and riskfree (free shipping)
<br>We make easy to contact us because we want to talk to our customers.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Return costs are free for customer, expensive for us - we see them as marketing expense
<br>
<br>Phone calls are powerful- you have customers attention for 5-10mins, if you get interaction right, customer will remember the experiemce for very long time and tells a friend
<br>#
<br>Call centers - while others are reducing cost, we see it as opportunity - in word of mouth and increase lifetime value of customer
<br>#
<br>Usually marketing departments assume that the lifetime value of a customer is fixed when doing their ROI calculations. We view the <strong>lifetime value of a customer to be a moving target</strong> that can increase if we can create more and more positive <strong>emotional associations</strong> with our brand through every interaction that a person has with us.
<br>#
<br>-
<br>Generate trust and loyalty, not buzz
<br>
<br>most of our efforts on the customer service and customer <strong>experience side actually happen after we’ve already made the sale</strong> and taken a customer’s credit card number. For example, for most of our loyal repeat customers, we do surprise upgrades to overnight shipping, even though we only promise them standard ground shipping when they choose the free shipping option.
<br>
<br>Efficient way to run a warehouse is to wait until orders pile up.
<br>We run 24/7 - we maximize for customer experience (giving customers orders as quickly as possible), not picking efficiency
<br>##
<br>
<br>Our warehouses are located 15mims from UPS distribution centre, what makes orders get delivered within 8 hours. 
<br>This creates wow effects which customer remembers for long time and tells a friend
<br>
<br>We received thousands calls and we see each contact as opportunity to build the best CS and CX
<br>
<br>Call Centres - Measuring handling time translates into CS worry to get customer off the line ass soon as possible what is not best CX
<br>#
<br>
<br>We don't measure calls and we don't upsell
<br>We just care about whether the rep goes above and beyond for every customer. We don't have scripts because we trust employees to use their best judgement when dealing with customers
<br>We want our reps to <strong>let their true personalities shine during each phone call so that they can develop a personal emotional connection</strong> (internally referred to as PEC) with the customer.
<br>
<br>When shoes are out of stock. Rep is trained to research at least 3 competitors to find them.
<br>We lose sale but we are not trying to maximize transaction
<br>We build lasting connection with each customer
<br>
<br>Most of our calls are not sales. We noticed customers call us 1-2 in lifetime - we want to make sure we use this opportunity to create a lasting memory
<br>##
<br>
<br>Sometimes customer calls because it's first time to return an item and want a little help stepping through process
<br>Sometimes customer asks for advice on wedding shoes
<br>Sometiˇes just feel a little lonely and wants someone to speak to
<br>
<br>-Trust and empowers your reps. Trust they can provide great service. They do. Escalations to supervisors should be rare
<br>
<br>-its ok to fire customers who abuse your employees
<br>
<br>-dont hide your contact. Not only a message for your customers but employees as well
<br>
<br>-view each contact as investment. Not as a cost to minimize.

<br>
<br>-have everyone celebrate great service. Share Wow stories, give the best service to everyone - customers, employees, vendors
<br>
<br>For new vendors we made tours in the office (get a sense of culture - one thing is to hear, another to live). As word of mouth spread we made them for everyone
<br>
<br>Give employees feel their role has purpose - more than job
<br>Give them feel they are in control of their career
<br>
<br>Culture aand brand are the same thing. Brand is an indicator of culture
<br>
<br>We didn't want to build brand around selling shoes. We wanted to build it around culture
<br>
<br>Ask customer about brand of entire industry (eg airline, not any specific company)
<br>-bad service bad CX, different than advertising projections
<br>#
<br>
<br>We said no to a lot of talents who would make an immediate impact.
<br>We felt they are not culture fit and we wanted to sacrifice short term benefits to protect culture for long term
<br>
<br>4 week Training program
<br>We go through company history, importance of customer service and long term vision
<br>They you are for 2 weeks on pjˇhone calls from customers - regardless team and title
<br>--back to our belief, customer service is not department, it's company
<br>#
<br>
<br>We give 2000 until end of course to make sure they are here not for paycheck. We want employees bilieve in long term vision and be part of culture
<br>
<br>10 core values
<br>Many companies have them but not commit to them. Employees don't know them this cannot live them
<br>If you commit to them , you are willing to hire and fire based on them
<br>J#
<br>
<br>Do more with less
<br>A little weird
<br>
<br>Make interviews based on core values
<br>#
<br>MS: if not formalized, list them out
<br>
<br>Be humble - is critical. there is many talented amd smart people - but are egoistical
<br>Someone would argue they would add value but that's why most corporations don't have great cultures
<br>
<br>As we grow processes may change, but core values remain the same
<br>
<br>Challenge get to everyone else: Make one improvement every week that makes Zappos better reflect core values
<br>-email templates, make employee book look less Zappos, more like employee book
<br>-doesnt have to be dramatic. May be adding a sentence or two. How many improvements there would be in a year, if everyone did one weekly?
<br>
<br>DELIVER WOW THROUGH SERVICE
<br>
<br>Do sth better than expected
<br>
<br>We are not average, our service is not average and we don't want our people be average
<br>#
<br>
<br>Everybody is expected to deliver wow - internally or externally
<br>
<br>"Random man made me favour. He refused to receive back, asked me to do  random acts of kindness to others"
<br>
<br>Change
<br>Dont fear of change, but drive it. Never accept status quo. -historically, companies in troubles are those unable to adapt or respond quickly
<br>#
<br>
<br>It's impottant that most of the changes are driven froˇ bottom up - frontliners, those closer to people's issues
<br>#
<br>
<br>Change to stay ahead. Others can copy you but can't copy your people and culture
<br>
<br>Think about what it means to improve by 1 percent per day
<br>Ask yourself what is the 1 percent improvement I can do today
<br>1 per cent a say = 37x better in a year
<br>
<br>BE FUNNY AnD LITTLE WEIRD
<br>We don't want to become like one of those big and boring corporates
<br>Be unconventional and create unique and memorable personality
<br>
<br>Side effect - Ed ncourages people to think outside the box and be innovative
<br>
<br>Get people engaged thanks to a little weirfnedd
<br>If people are engaged, company as whole becomesinnovative 
<br>
<br>What little weird thing we can dothat would make us different from everybody else?
<br>How much fun do you have at your job?
<br>
<br>CS
<br>Don't run away from customers who don't appear serious, they requests are ambiguous.
<br>-may occupy line from people with more serious problems
<br>-see them as opportunity and delight them - respond with same tone
<br>-do one thing different from other CS - have conversation, not just fix problem
<br>-never know what opportunities it ˇay create
<br>-creates individuality and authenticity - something human - people want to feel they are seeking to humans and to be treated as humans
<br>###
<br>
<br>TAKING RISKS
<br>If people don't make mistakes they don't take risks. We want them to take risks
<br>
<br>We want everyone to develop their gut about business decisions
<br>#
<br>
<br>Make mistakes as long as you learn from them
<br>We never want people to accept status quo because that's the way things have always been done
<br>
<br>Seek adventure and have fun exploring possibilities
<br>
<br>Being unconventional in solutions - because you are allowed to think outside the box - allows you to stay above
<br>
<br>Unconventionality - needed to hire many CS in short time - speed dating - organised chats - candidates and existing employees. 5 mins for each interview
<br>-introduce yourself with fun fact
<br>J#
<br>
<br><strong>THINKING OUTSIDE BOX</strong>
<br>“Give me an example from your previous job(s) where you had to think and act outside the box.” 
<br>• “What was the best mistake you made on the job? Why was it the best?” 
<br>• “Tell me about a time you recognized a problem<strong>area to improve that was outside of your job duties and solved without being asked to. What was it, how did you do it?”</strong>
<br><strong>TaKING RISKS</strong>
<br>“What’s an example of a risk you took in a previous job? What was the outcome?” 
<br>• “When was the last time you broke the rules/policy to get the job done?”
<br>
<br>
<br>Weverone has more potential than they realize. Our goal is to unlock it
<br>Has to be a joint effort - you have to want a challenge to stretch you
<br>
<br>The only reason we are not swamped with competition is we work hard and better than anybody else
<br>#
<br>
<br>It may seem sometimes like we don’t know what we’re doing. And it’s true: we don’t. That’s a bit scary, but you can take comfort in knowing that nobody else knows how to do what we’re doing either.
<br>
<br>'I realized how lucky I was to work in such a supportive environment, where I could come up with ideas and know I’ve been already given the go-ahead to “just do.”
<br>I became more confident and sure of my role as leader'
<br>
<br>Open communication
<br>Communication is always one of the weakest spots in any organization, no matter how good the communication is. We want everyone to always try to go the extra mile in encouraging thorough, complete, and effective communication.
<br>
<br>Culture
<br>:
<br>The best leaders are those that lead by example and are both team followers as well as team leaders. We believe that in general, the best ideas and decisions are made from the bottom up, meaning by those on the front lines that are closest to the issues and/or the customers. The role of a manager is to remove obstacles and enable his/her direct reports to succeed. 
<br><strong>The best leaders serve those they lead.</strong> The best team members take initiative when they notice issues so that the team and the company can succeed. The best team members <strong>take ownership of issues</strong> and collaborate with other team members whenever challenges arise. The best team members have a positive influence on one another and everyone they encounter. They strive to eliminate any kind of cynicism and negative interactions. Instead, the best team members are those that strive to create harmony with each other and whoever else they interact with. We believe that the best teams are those that not only work with each other, but also interact with each other outside the office environment.
<br>###
<br>
<br>A bad sign to see people walking away from problems
<br>
<br>Build and feel strong connection with colleagues and culture
<br>
<br>DO MoRE WITH LESS
<br>We believe in hard work and putting in the extra effort to get things done.
<br>
<br>always striving to make ourselves more efficient, always trying to figure out how to do something better.
<br>Never lose urgency in making improvements
<br>Never settle on good enough - good is enemy of great, and our goal is to be great - set and exceed high standards
<br>
<br>Resourceful
<br>
<br>Roadblocks aren’t a dead end here. They’re a welcome challenge.
<br>
<br>It’s more fun to talk with someone who doesn’t use long difficult words but rather short easy words like What about lunch?” —Winnie-the-Pooh
<br>
<br>It doesn't matter what your Core values are. What matters if you live them and commit to them
<br>They are iˇportamt for alignment to become default way of thinking
<br>
<br>Individual - character
<br>Company - culture
<br>
<br>At Nordstrom, I saw buyers abuse their vendors daily and use their positions of power for short-term wins; these buyers ultimately failed in the long run.
<br>Some who partnered closely with their vendors, treated them with respect, and created long-term opportunities; these buyers always had the best business.
<br>
<br>Zappos Golden Rule toward partners
<br>Treat others as you’d like to be treated. When vendors fly to visit our offices in Las Vegas, they are greeted at the airport by one of our Zappos shuttles. When they arrive at our offices, their buyer welcomes them as we take their sample bags off their hands so we can deliver them to the meeting room. If it’s their first time visiting our office, we give them a tour. We offer them drinks and snacks, basically anything we can do to make them feel comfortable. This is all far from industry standard, but if we were in their position, I’m sure we wouldn’t mind being treated this way.
<br>
<br>Vendors
<br>I’ll never forget the afternoon I turned my chair around and asked Tony what he thought about giving vendors <strong>access to the same information as our buyers</strong>. Traditionally in retail, information is hoarded, kept secret, and used as leverage against the vendors to get more out of them. Retailers wouldn’t want a vendor to know how well they’re doing so they can demand more. But if we created true <strong>transparency</strong> in our business, not only would they help us, they’d benefit as well.
<br>-extranet: see inventory levels, sales and profitability
<br>-why we do: vendors are experts - no one knows their brands better
<br>Why not leverage their knowledge to run our business better?
<br>
<br>Negotiations don't have to be arm-wrestling match. We try to collaborate
<br>If both parties are clear about their positions and objectives we work toward what we both want to achieve
<br>-we are clear about what makes sense for business. If we are looking for longer payment terms we present different plans
<br>
<br>When vendors hit 1M sales, we give when tshirt- my brand made a million of sales on Zappos
<br>When we dine we pay check
<br>We show appreciation by inviting on events they talk about for months
<br>
<br>If you have good relationships with vendors, you can ask them for more
<br>
<br>We involve them in our marketing campaigns and in decisions regarding directions  of their lines
<br>
<br>Layoffs
<br>Stick with core values and be honest
<br>
<br>Remember, this is not my company, and this is not our investors’ company. This company is all of ours, and it’s up to all of us where we go from here.
<br>
<br>Pipeline
<br>when the company outgrows an employee because the employee still has the same skill set that he had when he first joined. Then look for someone more experienced from outside. May not be a culture fit
<br>Pipeline approach - Rather empower your employees to grow. See every hire as entry. Company should provide all mentorship and training to become senior leadership in 5 years.
<br>We fill the entry positions with new hires
<br>We hire marathoners for running team. Campers for outdoor team
<br>If we didn't give them enough learning we would lose them
<br>
<br>Extend pipeline to 4 years before going. Work with college students, offer them internships
<br>
<br>PR and media
<br>If you receive more interest, keep doing what you do - improving customer experiemce and stretching culture
<br>
<br>Sending flowers to customers
<br>
<br>If you keep WOWing, press will discover it
<br>
<br>Public speaking
<br>-agreed because it was opportunity for brand
<br>as uncomfortable as I was with doing them, they were opportunities for me to grow both personally and professionally.
<br>I was so uncomfortable with process, even after year
<br>
<br>I realised no one knew what I forgot to say. But they liked personal stories I shared.
<br>They could feel the passion of company
<br>
<br>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as a type of happiness, in which someone loses sense of time, self-consciousness, and even self. That’s exactly what happened to me.
<br>
<br>Be passionate
<br>Tell personal stories
<br>Be real
<br>
<br>Once I agreed to speak about topic I wasn't passionate about. I knew content perfectly, I wasn't passionate and my performance was bad
<br>#
<br>
<br>Today, I will tell them I okay to speak about certain topics which may or may not match with theme of conference
<br>If not, politely decline
<br>
<br>Our board wasn't convinced of value of brand, pipeline, culture. They called it social experiments and wanted us focus on financial results (driven by e-commerce)
<br>
<br>Investors signed up for exit in 5 years, not for additional things we did.
<br>I saw much bigger potential we can achieve with our long term strategies
<br>
<br>Strong culture and core values were important because they create alignment among employees.
<br>Algnment with shareholders and board is just as important
<br>
<br>Top 10 Questions to Ask When Looking for INVESTORS and Board Members

<br>4. What is the <strong>time horizon for a financial exit</strong> that your investors are expecting? 
<br>5. What, if anything, are your investors hoping to get out of their involvement beyond just financial return? How would they prioritize those things? 
<br>6. Do your investors and board of directors <strong>buy into the vision and mission</strong> of the company?

<br>
<br><strong>Hi Jeff— I’m looking forward to meeting you in person on Thursday. I just wanted to set proper expectations before the meeting and reiterate that we are looking to grow Zappos as an independent company at this point in time, but are always open to exploring partnership opportunities. I look forward to hearing your ideas on Thursday…</strong>
<br>
<br>Amazon wanted do buy with cash.
<br>Didn't sit well with us.
<br>In our minds it felt too much as selling. Selling wasn't our goal. We wanted to continue building brand, culture, business. And we wanted to continue feeling like owners of company
<br>
<br>As it turned out, misalignment with board was blessing in disguise. You never know that something you perceive as negative will turn out to be a good thing
<br>
<br>You will hear Amazon bought Zappos.
<br>While these terms are technically correct, they don't properly convey the spirit of transaction
<br>
<br>To employees:
<br>What happens to our culture is up to us, which has always been true. Just like before, we are in control of our destiny and how our culture evolves.
<br>I could have it my way, I would have shared much earlier that we were in discussions with Amazon so employees could be involved in decision making process
<br>
<br>Amazon focuses on low prices, vast selection and convenience to make their customers happy, while Zappos does it through developing relationships, creating personal emotional connections, and delivering high-touch (“WOW”) customer service.
<br>
<br>What should we toast to? To infinity and beyond

<br>
<br>hHAPPINESS
<br>
<br>What's your goal in life
<br>(Family, business...)
<br>Why?
<br>Why?
<br>(Spend time with family, run marathon,..)
<br>If you keep asking why, you find out whatever they pursue will make them happier
<br>
<br>Research shows After achieving your goal happiness fades quickly.
<br>Happiness levels of lottery winners deforest winning and year after - reverts back
<br>
<br>Books about happiness: Happier and Happiness Hypothesis
<br>I thought reading them was side hobby which has nothing to do with Zappos. Then I realised it had everything to do.
<br>If your goal in life is to be happy, wouldn't it make sense to read research and apply to life?
<br>Or, if you applied this to your company, how happy your customers would be?
<br>
<br>I run my marathon. Never run more than a mile, knew nothing. Started reading books and articles about science behind it
<br>Strategy is to do long runs at slower pace - body can comfortably carry on without being out of breath
<br>
<br>Running slow seems counterintuitive. We instinctually know what to do that makes us happy
<br>
<br>You can perform better in marathon if you train things that initially seem to go against your gut and instincts.
<br>Science of happiness shows there are things that makes us happy which we don't realise. And things that you think do, will not on long run
<br>
<br>Happiness framework 1
<br>Can be applied to business as well
<br>1-PERCEIVED CONTROL
<br>We used to give fixed raises to reps, they didn't have control. We have 20skillsets (analogous to merit badges in Scouts) Decided to implement skill set system
<br>If you choose not to get trained and certified, you will stay on your pay level
<br>JESUS##
<br>
<br>2-PERCEIVED PROGRESS
<br>Small incremental steps work better than big leaps (for promotions). More sense of ongoing progress - happier employees
<br>
<br>3-CONNECTEDNESS
<br>More good friends employees have at work, the more engaged and productive they are.
<br>
<br>4-VISION,MEANING
<br>Higher purpose beyond money, profit, marketshare, is an important element of what separated great from good
<br>
<br>Happiness framework 2
<br>Chip Conley: Peak
<br>How to translate Maslow to business - once survival needs (food, mo ey,shelter) are fulfilled, humans are motivated by non-materialistic needs (status, achievement, creativity)
<br>Customer: meet expectations > meet desire > meet unrecognized needs
<br>Find item, free shipping, surpiˇrise upgrade to overnight shipping
<br>Employee: Money> Recognition> Meaning
<br>Many managers believe more money makes employees more happy, surveys show growth becomes more important
<br>Investors: Transaction Alignment > relationship alignment > legacy
<br>
<br>Happiness framework 3
<br>Types of happiness
<br>1 - pleasure - as soon as stimuli goes away, happiness level drops immediately. Rockstar - you need constant flow of stimuli
<br>2 - passion - more lasting, being in the zone, flow - peak performance meets peak engagement and time flies by
<br>3 - higher purpose - something bigger than yourself
<br>You should figure out higher purpose first (longest lasting), then layer passions on top of that and then pleasures
