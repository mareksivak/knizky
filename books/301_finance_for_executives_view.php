<br>Fundamental financial principle 
<br>-as a manager your objective is to create value for the owners 
<br>-if you fail, it will be unable to attract equity capital needed to fund activities. Without equity capital, won't survive
<br>-doesnt neglect / mean less value for employees, customers and suppliers - firms focused on creating value for owners build valuable relationships with other critical players. 
<br>In fact, caring about employees, suppliers, customers and community creates value for owners
<br>3
<br>
<br>-you need to translate Goodwill (delighting customers, dealing with employees) into higher firm value. If you fail, dissatisfied shareholders will question your strategy and push to produce satisfactory return on the equity they have invested in.
<br>-ok, should you focus on customers or shareholders? It's a false debate. Focus on making decisions to raise value of firm - doing so creates value for customers and stakeholders.
<br>4
<br>>>Before making decisions you should always ask if it creates value
<br>
<br>Net present value
<br>-a business roposalcreates value if NPV is positive and destroys if negative
<br>-NPV: present value of future net cash benefits minus initial cash outlay 
<br>-difference between proposals present value and initial cash outlay
<br>##same to think about value for customer - gains vs effort put in
<br>
<br>If NPV is negative, value of your company decreases. If project succeeds, value of stakes of shareholders increases
<br>Owner of project are owners of company which undertakes it - your investors - they provide initial cash
<br>
<br>To pretend competitors from entering your market erect entry barriers
<br>To make their project proposals costly enough
<br>-they should be motivate to innovate to make them irrelevant
<br>-example become strong brand hard to imitate, control low-cost market - hard to sell at cheaper price point
<br>-point is positive NPV businesses are hard to discovered

<br>
<br>Primary market - provides financing to fund new ventures and sustain growth
<br>
<br>Equity market - share price should adjust instantly to new and relevant information available to market participants
<br>Information - any piece of news expected to affect company's cash-flow.
<br>13
<br>
<br>Assets - cash, inventories, buildings - needed for production
<br>Liabilities - debts owed to banks and suppliers
<br>
<br>Equity capital
<br>Owners capital is riskier than lenders investment.
<br>Higher rate of return on equity investment
<br>Shareholders dislike risk- risk averse- require higher rate of return to compensate higher level of risk attached to equity capital.

<br>Firms are required to provide info about their transactions - to collect, organise and present according to standard rules

<br>
<br>Financial statement
<br>Formal document to provide financial information
<br>
<br>Liability - z√°v√§zky / long-term shortterm
<br>Depreciation - odpisy
<br>Payable - pohƒæad√°vky
<br>
<br>Statements- how information from balance sheets and income statements is related
<br>Usefulness is limited by quality of information they contain - principles are not necessarily applied in the same fashion and same rigor in all firms
<br>-for meaningful comparisons over time and between forms it's necessary to check what standards are used from period to period or company to company. If not, adjustments are need to be made
<br>-
<br>-
<br>For those reason always interpret statements with critical eye - always ask how reported figures are generated and what rules were used to estimate them

<br>Singer Co
<br>Without doing anything illegal and with the blessing of auditors at Ernst&Young, the company employs a myriad of tactics to brighten it's profit picture
<br>
<br>Things to look at forcriticism:
<br>- Profits too predictable
<br>Investors don't like to be surprised but it's suspicious of projections are completely on target especially when it's subject of fluctuating currencies
<br>- Family ties
<br>Look how they deal with related businesses. Relationships may be taken to advantage - parent or children companies may hold some businesses which can be bought back for low price
<br>- High volume of one off profits
<br>What they come from, are they able to replicate them next year?
<br>
<br>- *Cash is more important than earnings*
<br>At healthy companies cash-flow (exclude non cash items such as depreciation) approximates net income
<br>If they claim suspiciously high amount of cash flowing in (eg compared to last year) you can questioning all cash came from operations (eg borrowed cash, while cash from operations may trail earnings)
