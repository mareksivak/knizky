<br>Our belief is that if you get the culture right, then most of the other stuff, like great customer service or building a great brand, will happen naturally on its own.
<br>Culture -- companies are missing a culture made up of passionate, service-focused employees,

<br>Hire people that want to serve others
<br>Train, train, train
<br>
<br>Customer service unimportant
<br>Low loyalty to brand and product

<br>September 11, 2001, when most airlines were canceling flights and parking aircraft, Southwest maintained its loyal customer base, due largely to the personal relationships they had built with those customers through the years.
<br>
<br>self-talk can make or break how you feel about yourself, how you feel about your day, and how you feel about your customers.

<br>To become a better listener
<br>Listen
<br>Show you listen - good way is to restate what you heard, not repeat word by word
<br>Ask questions - respect time, get information quickly and accurately
<br>
<br>Notes
<br>If dealing with difficult issue, tell you're writing notes - this lets to know you are concerned
<br>Research shows custoˇers are 5x more confident if you write it down - "I'm writing this down..."

<br>Natural >> Natural
<br>Angry >> Show concern
<br>In panic >> Show sense of urgency
<br>Friendly >> Cheerful
<br>Overburdened >> Show sympathy
<br>Frustrated >> Show empathy

<br>How to deal

<br>,
<br>-deal with emotions first, use logic later
<br>Show sympathy (I would be upset too)
<br>Find areas of agreements (terrible you need to call again)
<br>Restate (you are concerned because this is the highest bill. I would be concerned too)
<br>-thank for bringing the situation to attention
