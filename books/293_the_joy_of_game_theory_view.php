<br>Dominant strategy
<br>Always should be played - gives you the best outcome, regardless of what your other choices are and what other people are doing.
<br>21
<br>
<br>Focal point
<br>Strategy that is natural. Allows people to coordinate without communicqfion.
<br>-
<br>Bank closes at rounded time - 5:00, 5:30, 6:00. Not at 5:04 - would be confusing to customer
<br>Where would you meet a stranger at NYC?

<br>-
<br>Focal points - coordinqte without communication
<br>
<br>Splitting soda evenly between 3 people.
<br>Pour 1/3equally into each glass - incomplete solution, describes outcome but not how its achieved. Who will pour? What order do people pick? How to make everyone trust each other?
<br>- person who pours pocks his glass last. Gives incentive to split evenly. As even as possible.
<br>-
<br>- splitting paycheck. Same mechanism
<br>- you're splitting between your child self (shortterm), teenager (midterm), inner adult (long term)
<br>Person who chooses last needs to be the  person splitting. Deduct 10 percent for your retirement first - pay your future self first.

<br>Coordination games
<br>Competitive games - each person seeks to be a winner, leading to breakdown of coordination - individual interest is often at odds with group interest.

<br>Financial advice may be good for you, but ofylten better for the adviser. This is why you should be skeptical of finance advice.
<br>So much of it is equivallent of a friend telling me to go for the brunette whele they will go for tge blonde.

<br>- only the patient puts in the extra effort: doctor gives medicine patient takes it.
<br>- neither one puts in extra effort: doctor gives medicine and patient does not take it
<br>Knowing that patient will ignore advice, doctor will perscribe medicine. Suspecting that patient will follow tge advice, doctor is tempted to perscribe medicine.

<br>Prisonners Dilemma of Reading.
<br>Locking content for subscribers. Get competotive edge. Access to kmowledge that others dont have.
<br>In this case you think of decisions of other people. Subscription is valuable for you only if othervpeople dont have it.
<br>59
<br>
<br>Its a bad thing to play in prisoners dilemna, as selfish motives and dominant strategies (extra chips in casino, if others buy, you have to too, as it gives you betting power)
<br>Lead to a destructive outcome of the group.

<br>Every traveller is competing with others who are making the same decision!
<br>63
<br>
<br>Southwest priority seating.
<br>If too many people play, bettrr seats cannot be guaranteed.
<br>People are stuck in the game. There is so many people playing, that Individuals cannot stop.
<br>Brilliant.
<br>64
<br>
<br>Changing the game.
<br>Dont get angry at a bad outcome. Often poor outcomes are not because of being stupid - its because other players are playing smartly!
<br>If things turn out poorly, dont get angry at the other people - look for ways to change the game.

<br>Before you start yelling at people for bad behavior,  see why they are thinking that way. Change the game and everybody can win.
<br>Lack of incentives
<br>Free rider - a person who gets benefits without contributing to cause
<br>A game of chicken - who swerwes loses
<br>73
<br>#
<br>
<br>To win a game of chicken
<br>- make yourself immovable: strategic lesson is to limit your options to become immovable. (Driver locks steering wheel to force another driver to swerwe)
<br>- lawsuit (the loser is who backs out, if no one does, botg suffer negative publicity, waste time and money): get a reputation of being tough
<br>- declare you have nothing to lose. You become more dangerous abd your threats are taken more seriously
<br>- raise the risks to your actions: terrorism, blocking the roads
<br>Bring everyone closer to brink unless the other side relents
<br>76
<br>###
<br>
<br>How to make threat credible
<br>1. Have an alternative - nothing scares more than having more offers
<br>2. Suggest having alternatives - negotiate job offer: offer is nice, but need more time to think about it. Ask for a small extension and indirectly suggest you're cinsidering other offers
<br>3. Use a risky threat - unlikely to happen, but fatal consequences if does - school camp, reporting bad behavior to admission officers
<br>
<br>Ultimatum game. Split 10 dollars between two, if no agreement, nothing for all. Player 1 has advantage of bargaining power and can offer 9:1. Knowing that any offer will be accepted.
<br>Player 2 can give a threat before game starts: if you dont offer at least 5, I will reject it. I dont care if you go home with nithing. I'pl be happy to know i hurt you. 
<br>In reality, people tend to reject unfair offers.

<br>
<br>Do not escalate conflicts, explosive for everyone.
<br>95
<br>
<br>Whoever said honesty is the best policy gad to be lying, and never learned about the game theory of credible threats.
<br>Lies have saved many messengers from veing shot, and many couples from explosive arguments about body image.
<br>Game theory suggests that lies can be beneficial to all parties. In many cases, policy of occasionaly lying is more effective tgan policy of strict honesty.
<br>Following statement is an example of effective lie: give me a lower ratr or I'm cancelling!
<br>I will nevrr be with you - ever!
<br>96

<br>
<br>Threat+lie : you need to prove your threat is credible to a few people.(chicken game)
<br>98
<br>
<br>Threating to many people
<br>Tips to use this strategic move:
<br>1. Enforce penatly quickly - punish popular student or one of their peers
<br>2. Target audience should witness the punishment - speaker will be able to send his message to audience
<br>3. Threat to repeat the punishment has to be credible - speaker has no hesitation to bring more students on stage.

<br>The Strategy of Limiting options
<br>1. Get better food on flight
<br>Pretend dietary needs. Food served to satisfy everyone. Demonstrate you are not the average customer by requesting specialty meal. Give a signal your tastes belong to a special group. Vegetarian food may likely have fresh fruit, which may not be appreciated by all passengers.
<br>Improve your situation by limiting options of what you say you can eat.
<br>#
<br>2. Get to work on better projects
<br>Managers decide staffing and make decisions based on how the people will react. Influence their decisions by limiting options. John stuck on boring projects, while Tim enjoys exciting work with a lot of travel.
<br>If you want better projects, figure out to limit your options to become less flexible.
<br>Subtly voice how unhappy you're in bad projects so you get reputation of not dojng well, while you are valued enough on good projects.
<br>Avoid long hours projects by filling your personal schedule by appointments you cannot miss (appointments out of your control - course, concert,...)
<br>#
<br>3. Give up some freedom to get more freedom
<br>Professor pride themselves for their freedom. Paradoxically, they sign up policies dealing with issues like grading, absent students,.. by limiting their authority they can tell students they have no control.
<br>-
<br>Limit your involvement in things you hate to have more time on things you love.
<br>#

<br>
<br>Negitiation - withold the supply.
<br>Baseball club - for less attractive game, block cheapest seats that sell out first. Decrease capacity by 20 percent, but make more.
<br>Nintendo - intentionally limit supply. All stores needs their consoles, but its obvious that some may be lft behind or never get them 
<br>
<br>Leaders dillema
<br>Choose between great outcome that might backfire or mediocre ones that work for sure.
<br>116
<br>#
<br>Leaders have to act first, so followers have time to observe flaws and criticise. Often good outcomes need cooperation, so they are more risky and less likely to win out.
<br>-- in turn, safer and mediocre outcomes rise to the top.
<br>---- change the game from sequential  to simultaneous play where players have to guess and commit actions. Make players move without full knowledge, so they can be all better off on average.
<br>116
<br>
<br>Leaders game.
<br>Ak protihráč má lepšie možnosti ak bude reagovať na tvoj ťah, donúť ho, aby konal súčasne s tebou.
<br>Because neither knows how exactly the other will respond, each will be forced to mix strategies.
<br>You need to randomize to become unpredictable, lije rock paper scissors.

<br>Voting paradox.
<br>- competition to get other members to support your preference
<br>- people are always complaining that they are victims of undlfair majority
<br>When you cannot get people to support your choice, life seems unfair and dictatorial
<br>- but we shouldnt get surprised. Situations where voters are collected are full of conflicting preferences
<br>127
<br>
<br>Voting paradox. No candidate can claim to be favorited by majority.
<br>Its impossible
<br>Voter 1: A>B>C
<br>Voter 2: B>C>A
<br>Voter 3: C>A>B
<br>If A wins, 2 and 3 find C better than A. If A,...infinite loop

<br>Game of waiting in lines - escalqtion game
<br>Defined by two strategic considerations:
<br>1 waiting is a wasting of time
<br>2 people who show up early can pick better seats, so clearly one would want to show up before anybody does.
<br>If you come earlier there is certaimly someone who came before you. Thos changes the game - people start coming earlier and earlier and ots uncommon to wait for hours or a hay for opening.
<br>Result us wasteful equillibrium - people wait in lines because everyone else is waiting too.
<br>Restaurants or theatres can monetize priority entries or distribute them randomly, but tgey prefer encouraging lines to produce buzz.
<br>139
<br>
<br>High heels.
<br>All women hate them. If none of them used them, there's a temptation to wear shoes to look taller. When a few women starts, it becomes tempting for other women
<br>- same results as waiting in lines - doing sth waateful because everybody else is dojng too.
<br>140
<br>
<br>Get people to do something by knowing everybody else is doing too.
<br>Reason to defect - individual gets better benefits than being part of group.
<br>They could cooperate, but they dont
<br>
<br>To win, you need to be more ruthles, more destructive, and more wasteful than others.
<br>You need to camp out the longest to get the best seats, study the hardest,...
<br>- beat them in your own game. Change the game and play by your own rules.
<br>- wait for a movie to get less popular, ignore trends, learn not for grades, have fun
<br>Spend time productively while others waste it.
<br>-
<br>I play for the long run, and I will find a way to win this game.

<br>If you can chhose between A: 50 usd for you, 25 for others, or B: 100 to you, 250 for others, many people chhose A: jealousy of otgers people success, having higher relative ranking in society
<br>145
<br>
<br>Jealousy
<br>Analogy: Everybody has a cup which is getting by water from the ocean. Diesnt matter how big your cup is and if your neighbours cup is bigger, since there is always enough water to go around 
<br>Success will come from building your own cup and filling it, not from shattering what your neighbor has.
