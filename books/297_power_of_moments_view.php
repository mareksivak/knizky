The Power of Moments
<br>
<br>We all have defining moments in our lives - meeting the love, teacher who spot talents, losses, gains, work
<br>They shape our lives, we can be their authors
<br>- what makes them memorable?
<br>- what are their sharwd traits?
<br>4
<br>
<br>When we recall an experience, we focus on moments that stand out. (Disneyland visit, forget queues, heat,...)
<br>7
<br>- duration is ignored. We rate peak moments and end
<br>- as result, your memory of the day is more favorable than hour-by-hour ratings
<br>
<br>Ľudia si najlepšie pamätajú začiatky a konce (napr.spomiemky)
<br>
<br>When you figure out what pleases your customers, you dont need to obsess every single detail
<br>(Hotel, average rooms, but free drinks, snacks, popsicles served on silver plate to the pool, ordered from red phone called popsicle line - defining moments in context of vacation)
<br>11
<br>
<br>New employee's first day - pay attention and dont waste opportunity to make him feel welcomed and included.
<br>- transition: intellectual (work), social (people), environment
<br>First day - peak moment, no bureaucracy; employee retention
<br>18
<br>
<br>
<br>Moments are the thing for peolle
<br>- achieve goal, milestone
<br>- transitions, celebrations
<br>- all these moments are invented to give shape to time
<br>- if we recognize how important tgey are, we can shape them and make more momorable and meaningful.
<br>19
<br>##
<br>
<br>If transition lacks a mement, it can become formless -> sets mental transition as well
<br>24
<br>
<br>Negative moments - eg waiting - distract, entertain, give comfort.
<br>28
<br>
<br>Airline cust. Satisfaction - you dont want to be perfect. Make customer to bring 2 things that went wrong to your attention and hustle like mad to fix them.
<br>29
<br>
<br>Moments - elevation, connection, pride. The more you multiply, ghe better
<br>
<br>- children hospital theming machibes as spaceships or pirate ships. Overcome childrens fear
<br>Transitions:
<br>-promotions
<br>-first day of school: why not to create a prigram that ovetcomes anxiety from a new place?
<br>-end of project
<br>35
<br>
<br>Milestones
<br>- achiebements
<br>
<br>Pits:
<br>-losses
<br>
<br>Case study
<br>Bank
<br>during relationship, landmark moments happen in time that involve bank - buying home, changing jobs, saving for education, wedding
<br>- transitions: gifts, congratulationary notes
<br>- job lossess, birth: mortgage holidays
<br>
<br>Moments of elevation
<br>- make us feel enfaged, joyful, amazed, motivated -> peaks
<br>
<br>Motivate students to being creative and study
<br>- Trial of Human Nature: a game where a random case from any book (eg Cain and Abel, Gandhi) is sued
<br>- makes learning experience memorable, creates challenge, final outcome unpredictable
<br>- each has a role: witness, attorney, judge. Jury comes from schools power people
<br>- trial: legal compliant against driver: are humans violent in their core? Is this against human nature?
<br>46
<br>
<br>In customer service, never play defence - dont try to make everything perfect (vague lobby area in hotel). Nail moments that will stay with customers
<br>#
<br>-
<br>There always be complaints. Aspire to build excellent service rather than complaint-free.
<br>To attract customers in unattainable goal, provide basics first (reasonably quick check in and rooms, comfortable beds, hot water)
<br>54
<br>
<br>Offense - Focus on jaw dropping experiences
<br>(Customers talked about coctail from a bar. Staffer track down recipe from bar, bought ingredients and made a surprise waiting in their room)
<br>#
<br>
<br>When customers contact for problems with service, play defense.
<br>Dont try to delight them
<br>55
<br>
<br>To exceed customers expectation, you need behavioral parts of the service - you need an element of surprise.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Rating from customers: 1 to 7
<br>1-3: eliminate negatives -> most companies spend 80 resources here!
<br>Improve negatives - as a strategic investment its madness
<br>#
<br>4-6: elevate positives -> 9x more revenue than eliminating negatives
<br>Happy customers spend more
<br>Airline: customer at 4 spends 800/yr, at 7 spends 2200/yr. Bring more people to higher ratings
<br>- more financial value in elevating positives
<br>51
<br>###
<br>
<br>To create remarkable moments, you need peaks.
<br>They dont emerge naturally, they must be created.
<br>61
<br>#
<br>
<br>Types: elevation, insight, pride, connection.
<br>Elevation
<br>1 boost sensory appeal - make things better than they do. Weddings have food, floweds music. No need to go super expensive
<br>2 raise stakes - add element of pressure: competition, game, performance, deadline, public commitment. You must do xx. Thats pressure.
<br>3 break the script - violate expectations about experience
<br>63
<br>#
<br>
<br>If people want to take photos: I want to remember this. Thats 1 - elevatuon.
<br>You do 2 well if cameras are pulled down.
<br>Watch out for lowering stakes: do we really need.mm? What if we just...? Is it practical to staff a hotline for free popsicles if you cam put them in freezer? "Being reasonable"
<br>63
<br>#
<br>
<br>Its no ones job to build experiences and there is always something more urgent
<br>#
<br>Control the rollout, otherwise imple.entation may get ignored
<br>64
<br>
<br>-
<br>Engagement fades when confronted with reality. Managing dependencies
<br>Once you do that you will be grateful for every single piece of effort - you created a defining moment
<br>
<br>Gene O'Kelly
<br>Perfect days.
<br>Look at your calendars -do you see perfect days ahead?
<br>If I told ylu to create 30 perfect days, could you?
<br>How long would it take? One day rolls into the next, and we still havent had that conversation we wanted to have. Still havent done....stil walk on a flatland that could be a mountain range.
<br>#
<br>66
<br>
<br>All plans had to be junked. The quicker i scrapped plans that no longer existed, the better.
<br>I needed to come with new goals. Fast
<br>66
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Break the script
<br>
<br>Surprise - make moment memorable
<br>Script - expected sequence of actions
<br>Lost stuffed toy. When found, asked stuff to take a photo on pool - told son Joshie is on vacation.
<br>
<br>71
<br>#
<br>
<br>To create memorable moments, you've got to break the script.
<br>Surprise matters, but how can you replicate delightful surprises?
<br>72
<br>
<br>Repetition turns surprise into expectation. Discontinue and receive complains.
<br>Add randomness
<br>Pret A Manger - free coffee (makes ne feel valued and encourage to come again)
<br>- staff has amount of free drinks to give away. Almost a third of the customers have ever received a free gift.
<br>73
<br>
<br>Restore surprise and humanity perjs. Loyalty cards would gave been systematized.
<br>Giveaways are delightful for staff too.
<br>Economic value - customers come again.
<br>74
<br>
<br>Negative variance - stores operate differently in a way it harms customer experience - eg sandwiches dont taste the same
<br>Positive variance - welcome humanity in a system. Break the script. Some customers want small talk, some speed. They have their moods.
<br>77
<br>
<br>"Being innovative starts with getting outside the office and it doesnt hurt. It feels goofld! It stimulates and stretches you."
<br>Powerpoints dont create emotions to make do sth. People need to do sth active. Break the script.
<br>81
<br>
<br>Customer centricity - get closer to customer
<br>
<br>JanSport 
<br>- thought of themselves as carry brand, people carrying thongs from A to B
<br>- people using their brand: students, commuters, extreme users - climbrrs
<br>- not just carrying, also used in 3rd places - coffee shops, buses, libraries
<br>- what if backpack of the future was a portable office desk? Built a pipeline of innovative products.
<br>
<br>Why time accelerates as we get older
<br>- becomes more routine, less novel
<br>- most of pur life events happen in young age: school, graduation, first job, relationships, children
<br>- get more novelty: variety os a spice of life. No one dines pepper and oregano though.
<br>- recognize your scripts and break them
<br>##
<br>86
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>Moments of elevation 
<br>- experiences that rise above the routine. Make us enjoyed, joyful, motivated
<br>- parties, weddings, football, spontaneus trips.
<br>#
<br>87
<br>
<br>Recipe to create elevation
<br>1. Sensory appeal: costumes, real courtroom
<br>2. Raise the stakes - winner gets glory
<br>3. Break the script - everything is different than normal rhytms of school
<br>- break expectations
<br>- strategic surprise
<br>87
<br>
<br>No one's job
<br>Fight with delays and compromises
<br>88
<br>
<br>Case study
<br>1. Break the script. Ok, now roam the ground. What did you notice? What can you observe?
<br>2. Raise the stakes - go further - add pressure/accountability - results will be shared with management
<br>3. Boost sensory appeal - role play
<br>3. Add pride - celebrate certain moments of accomplishment - multiply milestones, recognize others (contributions, anniversaries)
<br>90
<br>#
<br>
<br>Make situation unesacapeable.
<br>Disgust and shame are top peak moments.
<br>
<br>Sudden realisation
<br>- defining moment, bubble burst
<br>
<br>Microsoft Azure - howto realisehow off the track youare?
<br>Dont share findings. Ask toproemsreplicate
<br>
<br>Selling ideas
<br>- no one talks about solution (sanitation in Bangladesh <> you're eating your own shit)
<br>- pitching solution makes you a salesman - people are sceptical to pitches
<br>- dramatize problems (struggles to use software). Once they got them, their minds immediately turn to solution (cannot apprecoate solution until appreciate problem)
<br>- sell vision (work backwards)
<br>###
<br>108
<br>
<br>Classes
<br>- common way: making syllabus by breaking down the topics to lessons and exams
<br>- what do you want your students to know/be able to do in 5 yrs? (Interest in math) How much of the syllabus does advance them towards your dream?
<br>110
<br>
<br>Mentoring, changing someone:
<br>High Standards + Assurance formula
<br>"I'll be very critical to you because I've very high expectations and I know you can reach them"
<br>- 100 percent more effective than general statement
<br>- natural reaction: defense or mistrust
<br>123
<br>
<br>Great mentorship: high standards + assurance + direction + support
<br>- I have high expectations and i know you can meet them. Try this challenge and if you fail, I'll help you recover
<br>- powerful enough to transform careers
<br>123
<br>
<br>Freedom to fail vs protection
<br>- "how did you fail this week?"
<br>#
<br>- question to make easier to stretch
<br>- become immune to rejection
<br>- when you seek out situations you may fail, you dont do a good job and as result dont take risks
<br>#
<br>130
<br>
<br>Female founder ms blakeley, pantyhose product. Previously sales person / fax machines. Comfortable with rejection. Helped to build persistance in starting a company.
<br>130
<br>
<br>In order to win, put yourself into situation where you can fail.
<br>We will never know our reach unless we stretch.
<br>131

<br>
<br>Case study.
<br>Generate ideas by folowing principles enciuntered in book
<br>-
<br>Chinese restaurant 
<br>/ Great experiences are mostly forgettable
<br>/ Dont reinvent everything. Just invest into moments of magic
<br>Elevation / sensory appeal, break the script
<br>- offer signature starter for free?
<br>- tea for valued guests, steaming hot and scented towels?
<br>Connection
<br>- conversation starters
<br>136
<br>#
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>PRIDE
<br>
<br>You put more effort into doing sth, get more talented and accomplish more. These achievements spark pride.
<br>139
<br>
<br>2 ppeople doing same thing, experience different amount of pride
<br>- depending how tostructure the work
<br>- design for pride
<br>- hard work is essential, but doesnt guarantee experiencing defining moments
<br>140
<br>#
<br>
<br>Recognition
<br>
<br>UI: recognition can make a lasting impact, if comes from authority - teacher,...
<br>Add authority by fact proofing / scoreboards, ranks
<br>145
<br>
<br>Doesnt work on group level.
<br>Either extraordinarily high performer always wins, or there is a temptation to award everyone, including low performers.
<br>Cannot apply same standards to reach everyone.
<br>Works only on personal level. Compete with yourself
<br>
<br>Multiply milestones
<br>- provide structure that respects power of moments
<br>
<br>Running. Boring. Became meditating and relaxing
<br>
<br>Steve Kamb - Level up your life
<br>
<br>- set clear goals that lift up challenge as you grow
<br>- more challenging than to learn Spanish every day and to know someday
<br>
<br>Record things you accomplish
<br>
<br>Abstract goals (money, success - numerical, arbitrary, no milestones) are brainwashing
<br>Add planning - bring motivation and improve experience in addition to accountability
<br>168
<br>
<br>There are always ways to build skills and demonstrate value to the organisation.
<br>When you do we will salute you
<br>Eg build checklists
<br>- receive compliment you run meetings that are worthwile...
<br>170
<br>
<br>Pride.
<br>Hitting a milestone sparks pride. It should also spark celebration - a moment of elevation. Milestones deserve peaks.
<br>-
<br>Milestone effect - (marathon, distribution of runners in 3, 3:30, 4:00,... Tresholds)
<br>- desire to push milestone: final push of effort
<br>- milestones define conquerable moments and worth of it
<br>- 
<br>Scouts Badge program - multiple milestones and celebrations - recognition from peers, karate - belts - public award ceremonies
<br>171
<br>
<br>Interest in Presidents. History from books - feeling flat, imterest made it aquire 3 dimensions.
<br>
<br>courage is resistance to fear - not absence of fear.
<br>Mark Twain.
<br>181
<br>
<br>- perfect ability to supress natural urges
<br>181
<br>
<br>Pride
<br>- defining moments (child born)
<br>- milestones (promotion)
<br>- courage (stand what I believe in, refuse to cave)
<br>182
<br>
<br>- build gradual and graduatef practice
<br>// Military, overcoming fear of spiders by leveling up
