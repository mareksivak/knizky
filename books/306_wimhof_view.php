I reminded myself to be open — that you never know what the world has in store for you, who you might meet, what you might learn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stressful exposure - small doses - makes us stronger and healthier. Leads to powerful changes in our cells <br>
<br>
Are there natural ways to unlock positive changes of stress?<br>
<br>
People do more pushups than they ever thought by holding breath.<br>
Methods practiced by 90 year olds<br>
<br>
Win: whether you think you can or can't, you're right.<br>
<br>
The method requires engagement of body and mind, and at least some belief.<br>
<br>

<br>
More energy, less stress, stronger immune system?<br>
Sleep better<br>
Improve cognitive and athletic performance<br>
Boost mood<br>
Fight anxiety?<br>
<br>
We lost our ability to thrive in Extreme environments<br>
Things we built make us weaker<br>
<br>
I am not a superhero and I didn't invent these methods<br>
Cold exposure has been practiced for thousands of years<br>
<br>
People were able to revert diabetes, relieve Parkinson syndroms, sclerosis and autoimmune diseases<br>

“Oh, God, let this child live! I will make him a missionary!”<br>
<br>
She wasnt educatef formally<br>
<br>
Each child she were was a gift from God<br>
<br>
with her very strong belief in God, was attempting through her faith to invoke me into the world.<br>
<br>
I had yearning for something deeper , mystical<br>
At age of 4 I had epiphany - I saw light. I was in the middle of light.<br>
<br>
Andre and me shared love for unusual - and would save money to buy exotic plants<br>
<br>
Conventional intelligence was the emotional currency of the time. My older brothers strived to become the best in school, but I had no chance of that.<br>
<br>
But I always felt something like the black sheep of sorts, a little more strange, excitable, just different.<br>
<br>
Baking potatoes in little fire- the best food I have ever eaten<br>
With just a little bit of salt, they were so delicious,<br>
They represented our freedom, and no restaurant could ever match their flavor because we ate them in connection with nature.<br>
<br>
they lose sight of the true reality: nature, which stimulates, develops, and sharpens their senses.<br>
<br>
On Saturdays I could build something out of nothing<br>
<br>
13 - vegetarian in culture where everybody ate meat and considered that as perfectly normal thing to do<br>
<br>
I made an acquaintance of an older gentleman, who way - in his way *protesting against that culture*<br>
<br>
Live animals were being delivered by trucks and being killed. There was nothing natural about it, no hunter-gatherer human element.<br>
<br>
Reduced eating meat<br>
Suddenly I was a different duck in the pond. It seemed as if everybody were looking and pointing at me, saying, “You’re different, you’re different.” And I was. I nurtured my independence, building my own little world.<br>
<br>
By becoming a vegetarian, exploring esoteric disciplines, and wearing my hair long like a hippie, I was beginning to segregate from the normal culture. <br>
I suffered to suppress my nature like many do<br>
*Once I accepted I was different I made my peace with it*<br>
<br>
I learned to develop my own way<br>
<br>
I am a dropout. I am not ashamed in culture who looks upon the achievements.<br>
I am dropout who teaches professors<br>
*Being out of the flow caused me to follow natural flow of the things.*<br>
<br>
*Society fixated on results - need to be tangible, you need to be difinable to others* - banker, lawyer, whatever<br>
<br>
Not my path<br>
From birth, I wasbound to follow a different mission<br>
 <br>
I am not special - life is special and we should treat it in that way.<br>
<br>
Deliver newspaper in morning hours. *That is a very different dimension of the day,* when nobody is around and you are there in *sync* with your bicycle and the *elements of nature*.<br>
<br>
*Every day for 5 years I woke up at 3:30, did 50 push-ups and I was awake*<br>
<br>
Cycling to Spain<br>
we had really dry oats to eat which tasted like hazelnuts. Amazing<br>
*Immerse yourself in nature and your senses become activated.*<br>
You will find your appetite shifts from fixed meals - dry oats taste like feast<br>
<br>
Climate<br>
As weather gets warmer, people walk outside more - more social cultures<br>
<br>
Sitting in car is like watching a TV.<br>
When you travel by bike, everything is amplified because you forge a direct connection with that all<br>
I can still feel sweetness of the air<br>
<br>
You are the long and your Corona is more than a this g on your head - it's energy you radiate<br>
Comfort yourself, stand proudly with your Corona because that's you you are inside.<br>
I didn't understand this at that time. That connection<br>
<br>
I could speak little French but I could relate to people - I was giving them something beyond language<br>
<br>
Meeting open people liberated my mind<br>
Reconciled parts others seemed different<br>
<br>
Further from Netherlands we traveled, further from our conditioned beliefs - the closer I felt to myself - I could shake off prejudice I usually felt<br>
<br>
The other thing I remember about Wolfgang is that he *listened intently to everything I had to say*. <br>
He was a man of considerable experience<br>
He *treated me and my ideas with respect*, never dismissiveness.<br>
<br>
Andrew was more down-to-earth, more practical. He biked a mile ahead of us while we talked about philosophy<br>
<br>
We came back to NL, returned to the turmoil of things, into conditioning
