<br>Make Time is not about productivity. It’s not about getting more done, finishing your to-dos faster, or outsourcing your life. Instead, it’s a framework designed to help you actually create more time in your day for the things you care about, whether that’s spending time with your family, learning a language, starting a side business, volunteering, writing a novel, or mastering Mario Kart.

<br>&--
<br>
<br>Getting to work was a daily battle against the elements. And one day I woke up with a shocking realization: I couldn’t remember the last two months.
<br>30
<br>-
<br>And I wanted to remember that time, because things were going well. I had a good job, a great girlfriend, and close friends who lived nearby. 
<br>-
<br>I didn’t know what was wrong, but I sure did want to figure it out. So, naturally, I began experimenting.
<br>
<br>While working at a fast-paced tech startup, I became obsessed with making the most of every hour.
<br>Carefully planned day, zero inbox.
<br>-
<br>I was so focused on small tasks that the days slipped by even faster than before. The blur was getting worse.
<br>30
<br>
<br>I decided to overhaul my approach. Instead of obsessively managing my minutes, I turned my attention to the long term. I created lists of one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year goals, which I asked my girlfriend to review and discuss with me. (The next year she married me, so I guess she was on the same page with at least one of my goals.)
<br>30
<br>
<br>My experiments weren’t working. I was stuck between day-to-day minutiae and too-far-away goals
<br>30
<br>
<br>I realized I didn’t need perfectly planned task lists or well-crafted long-term plans. Instead, it was simple but satisfying activities that helped stop the blurring of time. For example, I started meeting a group of friends every Friday for lunch . I would look forward to that all week. Run along the lakefront after work. Leave the office early, walk to the harbor, and go sailing for a few hours before sunset. 
<br>31
<br>
<br>I began to think of my work in terms of more meaningful activities, too. Instead of checking off as many to-dos as possible or racing to clear my inbox before heading home, I focused on accomplishments that were satisfying and important.
<br>-
<br>One day I found myself looking forward to a big presentation I was giving to executives, and I realized it was similar to the satisfaction I got from the lunches, lakefront jogs, and evening sails. 
<br>31
<br>#
<br>
<br>I had plenty of mundane stuff to get done, like answering emails, keeping our apartment clean, and returning library books before the deadline. And I did get those things done, but they weren’t where I directed my greatest focus.
<br>32
<br>
<br>If, at the end of the day, someone asks you, “What was the highlight of your day?” what do you want your answer to be?
<br>-
<br>Accomplishment or moment you are the most proud of
<br>33
<br>
<br>Your Highlight gives each day a focal point. Research shows that the way you experience your days is not determined primarily by what happens to you. In fact, you create your own reality by choosing what you pay attention to.
<br>33
<br>
<br>Highlights - Urgency
<br>Instead of thinking about deadlines and priorities, take a different approach: Think about the sense of accomplishment locked inside each potential Highlight.
<br>Look for activities that are not urgent. Instead, consider projects you’ve been meaning to get around to but haven’t quite found the time. 
<br>34
<br>#
<br>
<br>Highlights - Joy
<br>That means doing some things just because you like doing them.To other people, some of your joyful Highlights may look like wastes of time: sitting at home reading a book, meeting a friend to play Frisbee in the park, even doing a crossword puzzle. Not to us. 
<br>-
<br>You only waste time if you’re not intentional about how you spend it.
<br>34
<br>#
<br>
<br>A good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes. If you spend less than sixty minutes, you might not have time to get in the zone, but after ninety minutes of focused attention, most people need a break. Sixty to ninety minutes is a sweet spot. It’s enough time to do something meaningful, and it’s a reasonable amount of time to create in your schedule. 
<br>35
<br>
<br>You’ll realize the real power of this tactic on the days you don’t
<br>use it: knowing you can safely ignore small, nonurgent tasks, letting them pile up while you focus on your Highlight.

<br>
<br>Might-do list
<br>Separate tasks from execution.
<br>Buying boat takes on a project with hundreds todos to get the boat ready. From small (buy towels) to intense (cleaning plumbs so it's safe to drink water).
<br>-
<br>If we had worked directly from our to-do list, we would have been overwhelmed. Instead, we used a Might-Do List to help us stay organized (and sane!) and ensure that we were making time for the important tasks rather than frittering away day after day on the easy stuff.
<br>44
<br>
<br>Schedule time for yourself. Do your work, ypur rituals (gym, breakfast), dont get disturbed by anyone .
<br>Googles Adwords manager. Giving support toemployees involved in everything from design, testing, dev. People thought he takes crazy hours. In fact worked normal office hours. 6-11am time to his work, after that meetings.
<br>Get dosciplined, never let people overschedule it. "I already have plans"
<br>51
<br>
<br>Bulldoze meeting:
<br>- push meetings around
<br>- compress be 15m or 30mins
<br>-
<br>you might have more control over your calendar than you think. There’s no harm in telling people something important came up and asking if they can meet a little earlier or later or for a quick chat instead of for an hour.
<br>##
<br>Clear time for your highlight.
<br>-
<br>In fact, when meetings are shortened or disappear from the calendar, people are usually thrilled. 
<br>53
<br>
<br>We all try to say yes to meeting requests because that’s the default in virtually every office culture. But don’t assume there’s a good reason behind the length of every meeting or the time of day it shows up on your calendar or even why you were invited. Office schedules congeal organically, like pond scum. It’s okay to clean things up.
<br>53
<br>
<br>Say No by default.
<br>Avoid taking on low important projects.
<br>- “Sorry, I’m really busy with some big projects, and I just don’t have time for anything new.”
<br>- “Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to do a great job on this.”
<br>- Invited to an activity or event that you know you won’t enjoy? “Thanks for the invitation, but I’m not really into softball.”
<br>-
<br>- Offer encouragement or gratitude. Something as simple as a “Thank you for thinking of me; this sounds really fun” 
<br>-
<br>Be nice but honest.
<br>53
<br>###
<br>-
<br>We’re the kind of people who default to yes. We wish we could do it all, and we want to be helpful. And to be honest, it’s partly a lack of guts. It’s much easier to say yes. Saying no to an invitation or a new project can feel uncomfortable, and we’ve lost many hours, days, and weeks of Highlight time because we didn’t have the courage to decline a commitment up front.
<br>53
<br>
<br>We’ve found that we’re much happier when we default to no. 
<br>53
<br>
<br>Just because you’re saying no to this request doesn’t mean you can’t say yes in the future. 
<br>Again, say it only if you mean it. 
<br>“I really appreciate the invitation, and I’d love to hang out another time.” 
<br>Or “It means a lot that you’d ask for my help, and I hope we can work together in the future.”
<br>Offer encouragement or gratitude. Something as simple as a “Thank you for thinking of me; 
<br>53
<br>##
<br>
<br>Plan your details to every moment and detail (coffee break, shower, checking email). It might seem it takes your freedom, but it will actually make you free.
<br>But a completely planned day provides the freedom to focus on the moment. Instead of thinking about what to do next, you’re free to focus on how to do it. You can be in the flow, trusting the plan set out by your past self. When is the best time of day to check email? How long should it take? You can design the answers ahead of time rather than reacting in real time.
<br>55
<br>##
<br>
<br>When should you quit? Instead of trying to answer every email (not happening) or finish every task.
<br>As quitting time approaches, think about whether you accomplished your Highlight. If you have, you can rest knowing you made time for the day’s most important job.
<br>-
<br>It can be hard to stop work as there is “just one more thing” mentality. One more email. One more to-do.
<br>“Just one more thing” seems as responsible and hardworking thing to do. But it isn’t. 
<br>Working till exhaustion makes us robbing us of the rest we need to prioritize and do our best work. 
<br>Trying to cram in just one more thing is like driving a car that is running out of gas: No matter how long you keep your foot on the accelerator, if the tank is empty, you aren’t going anywhere. You need to stop and refuel.

<br>
<br>Why always-available, always-new entertainment apps that make you distracted?
<br>There are decades spent to make these product as easy to access as possible. The key to keep a laser sharp focus is is to bring those barriers back.
<br>-
<br>The best way to defeat distraction is to make it harder to react.
<br>-
<br>When distraction is hard to access, you don’t have to worry about willpower. You can channel your energy into making time instead of wasting it.
<br>73
<br>#
<br>
<br>Rather than ping-ponging between distraction and attention, you not only make time for what matters most, you make higher-quality time. Every distraction imposes a cost on the depth of your focus. When your brain changes contexts—say, going from painting a picture to answering a text and then back to painting again—there’s a switching cost. 
<br>73
<br>
<br>If you change your priorities, people will notice. Your actions show others what’s important to you.
<br>75
<br>
<br>Morning check-in.
<br>Don’t reach for email, Twitter, Facebook, or the news right away. It’s very tempting to do a check-in first thing in the morning and get the latest updates; after all, something in the world always changes overnight. But as soon as you fire up that screen, you start a tug-of-war of attention between the present moment and everything out there on the Internet.
<br>Put it off. The longer you postpone the morning check-in—until 9 a.m., 10 a.m., or even after lunch—the longer you preserve that feeling of rested calm and the easier it is to get into Laser mode.
<br>Then, after I wake up and make coffee, I’m ready to start my Highlight without any distractions from the morning check-in.
<br>87
<br>
<br>I can gather all the news I need on the weather report.
<br>88
<br>
<br>Smart people follow the news. Responsible people follow the news. Grown-ups follow the news.
<br>You don’t need to follow the daily news. True breaking news will find you, and the rest isn’t urgent or just doesn’t matter.
<br>88
<br>
<br>Go to your favorite news website. Look at the top headlines and think critically about each one. Will that headline change any decisions you make today? How many of those headlines will become obsolete by tomorrow, next week, or next month?How many of those headlines are designed to provoke anxiety? “If it bleeds, it leads” is a newsroom cliché.

<br>
<br>And I might enjoy football season a little bit more, but it would take a lot more time. Instead, I focus on the highlights—the parts that bring me real joy—and use the rest of my time for other things that matter.

<br>
<br>Online, anyone can contact you, not just the highly relevant people in your physical vicinity. They have questions about their priorities—not yours—when it’s convenient for them—not you. Every time you check your email or another message service, you’re basically saying, “Does any random person need my time right now?” And if you respond right away, you’re sending another signal both to them and to yourself: “I’ll stop what I’m doing to put other people’s priorities ahead of mine no matter who they are or what they want.”
<br>103
<br>##
<br>
<br>Of course, when you limit your email time or increase your response time, you may need to manage the expectations of your colleagues and others. You could say something like this:
<br>“I’m slow to respond because I need to prioritize some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.”
<br>103 
<br>#
<br>
<br>For example, at Google Ventures, everyone knew that the two of us didn’t respond to email quickly. If they needed something faster, they’d text us or find us in the office. But we never issued a memo about our policy. We were just slow, and people figured it out. That gave us more time for our design sprints and more time to write. In other words, more time for Laser mode and more time for our Highlights.
<br>103
<br>#
<br>
<br>Some work—such as sales and customer support—really does require fast responses. But in most jobs, any reputational damage you might suffer by being slow (probably less than you think) will be more than compensated for by the increase in time for your most meaningful work.

<br>The Power of Habit: First, a cue prompts your brain to start the loop. The cue triggers you to perform a routine behavior without thinking, on autopilot. Finally, you get a reward: some result that makes your brain feel good and encourages it to run the same routine again the next time you encounter the cue.

<br>
<br>Pen and paper
<br>While most software is designed to guide you through a series of steps that will lead to a finished product, paper allows you to find your own way to a cohesive idea. And paper opens up possibilities, because on paper, you can do anything at all.

<br>
<br>To stay in the zone
<br>You’ll feel a burning desire to know Who was that actor in that movie?18Instead of reacting to every twitch, write your questions on a piece of paper (How much do wool socks cost on Amazon? Any Facebook updates?). Then you can stay in Laser mode,
<br>122
<br>
<br>1. Breathe in through your nose. Notice the air filling up your chest.
<br>2. Breathe out through your mouth. Notice your body softening.
<br>Paying attention to your body shuts up the noise in your brain. And even a pause that lasts only one breath can bring your attention back to where you want it—on your Highlight.
<br>122
<br>
<br>Be stuck
<br>when you’re stuck, you know exactly what you want to do—your brain just isn’t sure how to proceed. 
<br>122
<br>
<br>If you still don’t have Laser mode in you, don’t beat yourself up. You might need a rest day. Energy—especially creative energy—can fluctuate, and sometimes you need time to replenish it. 
<br>123
<br>
<br>Sleep quality is more important than quantity, and our world is full of barriers—from screens to schedules to caffeine—to getting good sleep.

<br>What you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while.—GRETCHEN RUBIN
<br>139
<br>
<br>Modern culture encourages these unrealistic expectations about exercise.
<br>Do more, faster, and better.
<br>Anything less doesn’t count.
<br>Go small. 5 mins of excercise instead of 30 is more than none.
<br>It’s okay to not be perfect. Making the shift to daily doable exercise might mean giving up bragging rights.

<br>
<br>A daily walk doesn’t have to be “one more thing to do.”
<br>Make your phone calls, take a book with you, think and do your work mentally.

<br>Eat real food
<br>such as plants, nuts, fish, and meat—made a huge difference in our energy levels. After all, the human body evolved to eat real food, so it’s not surprising that your engine performs better when you give it the expected fuel.
<br>-
<br>I found that cooking with simple whole-food ingredients—like roasted meat with a salad—was much easier than following a long recipe point by point. For me, it was the best way to make a routine of eating like a hunter-gatherer.

<br>
<br>The tricky thing about caffeine is that if you wait to drink it until you get tired, it’s too late: The adenosine has already hooked up with your brain, and it’s hard to shake the lethargy.
<br>156
<br>
<br>To keep a steady energy level throughout the day, try replacing high doses of caffeine with more frequent low doses. Green tea is a great option. The easiest and cheapest way to run this experiment is to buy a box of green tea bags and try substituting two or three cups of tea for every cup of coffee you’d normally have.
<br>157
<br>
<br>A single espresso is roughly comparable to half a cup of coffee or two cups of green tea.
<br>158
<br>
<br>What most people don’t realize is that the half-life of caffeine is five to six hours. So if the average person has a coffee at 4 p.m., half the caffeine is out of the bloodstream by 9 or 10 p.m., but the other half is still around. The upshot is that at least some caffeine is blocking at least some adenosine receptors for many hours after you have caffeine and very possibly interfering with your sleep and in turn the next day’s energy.You’ve got to experiment to figure out your own unique “Last Call for Caffeine,” but if you have trouble sleeping, your last call might be earlier than you think. Experiment with cutting yourself off earlier and earlier and note if and when it becomes easier to fall asleep.

<br>Checking apps will not refresh your brain. Makes you glued to your chair, employs your mind with new things.
<br>Instead, try to take breaks without screens: Gaze out the window (it’s good for your eyes), go for a walk (it’s good for your mind and body), grab a snack (it’s good for your energy if you’re hungry), or talk to someone (it’s usually good for your mood unless you talk to a jerk).
