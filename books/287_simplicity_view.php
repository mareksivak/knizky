<br>I disagree when teachers give their students
<br>candy and other perks for correct answers, but I also disagree
<br>with a colleague at MIT who throws erasers at students that
<br>fall asleep during class.
<br>Instead, my ten years of data as a professor show that giv-
<br>ing students a seemingly insurmountable challenge is the best
<br>motivator to learn. 
<br>-
<br>But after recently experiencing student life myself, I've
<br>lost my masochistic attitude in favor of a holistic approach:
<br>-
<br>basics are the beginning.
<br>repeat yourself often.
<br>avoid creating desperation.  
<br>inspire with examples.
<br>never forget to repeat yourself.

<br>
<br>It was upon maybe the third visit that I real-
<br>ized how although Weingart was saying the exact same thing,
<br>he was saying it simpler each time he said it. Through focusing
<br>on the basics of basics, he was able to reduce everything that he
<br>knew to the concentrated essence of what he wished to convey.
<br>His unique example rekindled my excitement for teaching.
<br>36
<br>
<br>
<br>Repeat-ing yourself can be embarrassing, But there's no need
<br>to feel ashamed, because repetition works and everyone does it,
<br>including the US president.
<br>-
<br>Simplicity and
<br>repetition are related, as supported by story on the
<br>re-election of George W. Bush in 2004. On the campaign trail Bush delivered the
<br>same simple message on terrorism and Iraq repeatedly.

<br>Simplicity and complexity need each other. The more com-
<br>plexity there is in the market, the more that something simpler
<br>stands out. 
<br>---
<br>And because technology will only continue to grow
<br>in complexity, there is a clear economic benefit to adopting a
<br>strategy of simplicity that will help set your product apart.
<br>
<br>Iwas once advised by my teacher Nicholas Negroponte to
<br>become a light bulb instead of a laser beam His point was that you can
<br>either brighten a single point with laser precision, or else use
<br>the same light to illuminate everything around you.

<br>Striving for excellence usually entails the sacrifice of everything in the

<br>
<br>Feeling of being lost is implied by complexity, simplicity implies feeling of being found.

<br>Simplicity can be consifered ugly. Take pekple who absolutely despise anything of neutral color or minimalist form.
<br>
<br>they want neon frogs, bejeweled frogs and other decorative materials. When it xomes ro aesthetics, everything has to be bling.

<br>Simler objects are easier and less expensive to produce. However, some people would say, simplicity is not only cheap, it looks cheap as well.

<br>There will always ve die-hard Modernists who refuse any object that is not white or black, or with clear or mirrored surfaces.

<br>More emotions are better than less.
<br>When emotioms are considered above everything else, don't be afraid to add more ornament or layers of meaning.
<br>#
<br>This can contradict to the Law of REDUCE - tool to determine right kind of more: feel and feel for - everything starts from being sensitive to your feelings.
<br>Form follows function -> (gets more emotional approach) Feeling follows function.
<br>64
<br>
<br>Why people buy gadgets like cases?
<br> The combination of a simple object together with
<br>a host of optional accessories gives consumers the benefit of
<br>expressing their feelings and feelings for their objects.
<br>While object jeeps its pure naked ess, clothes give him sense of human warmth
<br>67
<br>
<br>Modernism is the design movement that led to the clean,
<br>industrial look of many objects in our environment. It rejected
<br>unnecessary ornament in favor of exposing an object's truth
<br>through the raw materials of its production. Japan's rich tradi-
<br>tion of almost perfectly crafted artifacts of wood and clay seems
<br>built on the same design principles as Modernism.

<br>Concentrate on the deep beauty of a flower. Notice the
<br>many thin, delicate strands that emanate from the center and
<br>the sublime gradations of hue that occur even in the simplest
<br>white blossom. Complexity can be beautiful. At the same time,
<br>the beautiful simplicity of planting a seed and just adding water
<br>lies at even the most complex flower's beginning. A relatively
<br>simple bit of computer code can produce surprisingly complex
<br>visual art. Conversely, Google's complex network of servers and
<br>algorithms produces a simple search experience.

<br> I am the

<br>Every day some of the smartest young people in the world
<br>come to see me in my o≈ce at MIT. Although o≈cially I am
<br>their teacher, I find that Iam often their student. For instance,
<br>Iremember a student named Marc who volunteered in shelters
<br>for poor people at the end of their lives. Even though he came
<br>from a well-heeled family, Marc said he always felt compelled to help oth-
<br>ers in need. He told me how while working at the shelter, he
<br>noticed that each patient had a single shelf by their bed that
<br>held the total sum of their worldly belongings. Seeing this situ-
<br>ation made him silently ask, "What arethe few precious things
<br>that you can aΩord to keep at the end of your life when you
<br>already have so little?" A ring, a photograph, or another small
<br>memento was what he consistently found. Marc poignantly
<br>surmised that memories are all that matter in the end.
