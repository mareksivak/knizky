<br>For me there wasn't a clear path. Decision-making process is an enjoyable part of journey.

<br>I had an arching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, and I wanted mine to be meaningful.

<br>
<br>The world was so overrun, I thought, the only answer was to find some prodigous dream that seem worthy, fun and chase it with athlete's single minded dedication.

<br>
<br>You tell yourself you're running toward some goal, but really you run because alternative, scares you to death. Whatever comes, just don't stop. Don't give too much thought to where "there" is.
<br>7
<br>
<br>If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that.

<br>I wanted to dive deeper before i started my journey. I wanted to explore the grandest temples, holliest rivers and mountaintops. To feel presence of...God.

<br>Im that time, 90 percent of Americans had never been to plane. Average man had never ventured farther than 100 miles from their front door.

<br>The last thing I wanted was to return to Oregon. I couldn’t travel around the world alone, either. Go home. Get a normal job. Be a normal person.
<br>Then I heard another voice: Don't go. Keep going. Don't stop.

<br>
<br>I needed to change my approach. I was a LINEAR thinker. According to Zen, linear thinking is nothing but delusion, one of many that keeps us unhappy. Reality is nonlinear.

<br>I went to Vienna, that monumentous, coffee-scented crossroads, where Stalin, Trotsky, Tito, Hitler, Jung and Freud lived, at the same historical moment, in the same cafés, plotting how to save the world.

<br>You ask, what is our aim? Victory, at all costs, in spite of all terror,...without victory there's no survival.

<br>He detested being called coach. He saw himself as a Professor of Competitive Responses and his job was to get you ready for the struggles and competitors that lay ahead, far beyond Oregon.
<br>58
<br>
<br>I'd been unable to sell encyclopedias. Why was selling shoes so different?
<br>It wasn't selling. I believed that if people ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.
<br>Belief is irresistible.

<br>I handed him a Tiger flat, topd about my trip to Japan, my meeting with Onitsuka.
<br>72
<br>- always have story

<br>
<br>I tried to talk to myself, to coach myself up.
<br>76
<br>
<br>I thought back on my running career. I'd competed against men far better, stronger, more physically gifted.
<br>I trained myself to forget this unhappy fact. Tye art of competing is the art of forgetting. You must forget your limits.

<br>Torii gate - sacral borderland, portal between this world and the world beyond.
<br>85
<br>
<br>In 1965 running wasn't a sport. It just was. To go out for run was what weirdos did. Running for pleasure, excercise, to live better and longer - tvese things were unheard of.
<br>Johnson wanted to bring runners into light, enfold tgem in a community.
<br>96
<br>
<br>Was keep being told from everyone his equity is not enough for growth. To slow down.
<br>Roadside was littered with cautious and conservative entrepreneurs.  I wanted to keep my foot pressed hard on gas pedal.
<br>99
<br>
<br>If I don't keep growing, I wont be able topersuade Onitsuka I'm the best man to distribute their shoes. If i cant persuade them, they'll find some other guy to take my place.
<br>I doubled my order with Onitsuka, showed up in a bank, asking for a letter of credit to cover it. My banker would always be shocked. You want HOW much? I'd always pretend to be shocked that hw was shocked.
<br>After I sold out the shoes, repaid borrowing in full, I placed a mega order with Onitsuka, then go to the bamk with a suit and angelic smile.

<br># game theory
<br>
<br>Onitsuka: inspiration for running shoes came from eating sushi. Lookingat his wooden platter, at the underside of an octopus's leg, he thought a similar suction cup might work  on the sole of a rumner's flat. Inspiration can come from quotidian things.

<br>People make mistake thinking that only elite Olympians are athletes. But everyone's athlete. If you have a bory, you're an athlete.

<br>One lesson Itook about heroes (Churchill, Kennedy, Tolstoy) was they didn't say much.
<br>Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.

<br>Customer data files - each customer got his index card. Personal information, shoe size, shoe preferences. This database enabled him ti keep in touch and make tgem feel special. 
<br>He sent them Christmas cards, birthday cards, notes of congratulation after they completed big race.
<br>Most customers liked them. Most wrote back. They'd tell about their lives, troubles, injuries. Johnson wouldsympathize and advise.
<br>Injuries. In 1960s injuries in sport were something new. Johnson's letters were filled withinformation impossible ti get anywhere else.

<br>First ever retail store.
<br>Bought the most comfortable chairs, created a beautiful space for runners to hang out and talk. Built shelves and filled with books every runner should read. Covered thewallswith photos of Tiger-shod runners.

<br>How to give a threat:
<br>- i've been responsible for any success we had so far and any success that will be coming in for the next two years.
<br>1. Make him a full partner
<br>2. Raise salary to 600, plus a third of all profits beyind the first 6000 pairs sold.
<br>Or, else goodbye.

<br>Nearly 60 years later it gives me chills to recall his voice, his tine. No one could get your blood going like Bowerman, though he never raised his voice. He knew to speak in sublimal italics.

<br>I was putting in 6 days a week in PWC, spending early mornings and late nights, weekends and vacations in Blue Ribbon.
<br>No friends, no excercise, no social life.
<br>Life out of balance, didnt care.
<br>
<br>I wanted to focus constantly on one task that MATTERED.
<br>I wanted to be me, full time.

<br>
<br>Blue Ribbon was doubling sales but still couldnt cover cofounders salary. Needed to look for a job making more many and tequesting less time.
<br>
<br>As fall 1968 arrived balance of my lofe shifted as i planned.
<br>I was following path that felt like my path, and though I wasn't sure where it would lead, I was ready to find out.
<br>152

<br>
<br>I didn't want to work for anybody else. I wanted to build something that was my own, something I could say: I made tgat. That wasthe only way I saw life meaningful.

<br>The chaos was the rule.
<br>
<br>Back home part of team - Woodell, Johnson, Penny.
<br>In Japan - Kitami and all the good people of Onitsuka.
<br>By nature I was loner, but since childhood I'd trived in teamsports.
<br>My psyche was in true harmony when I had a mix of alone time and team time.

<br>Storm wiped out his home.
<br>He'd started over. As Japanese do.

<br>I said I hoped one day to be as fluent in Japanese as he was in English.

<br>Most sales reps I hired were ex-runners and eccentrics. When it came to selling they were all business.

<br>I told him if he wasn't happy with me or my management style, he should know that quitting or being fired were two viable options.
<br>Woodell topd him I wasn't sleeping much, with new baby and all. 
<br>Tild him I was feeling stredd after visit from Kitami.
<br>Joked that ecerybody bitched about my style, nonresponses.
<br>He discovered Brook was stressed too.

<br>
<br>Shaky moment.
<br>Bank refused to give loan.
<br>Supply from Japan unusually came on time, asking to pay in advance.
<br>Looking for VC, no one interested.
<br>I blamed econony. I blamed Vietnam. But first and foremist I blamed myself. I'd overvalued my life's work.
<br>Over my first cuo of coffeein the morning, I'd tell myself: maybe I'm a fool?
<br>200
<br>
<br>I'm just not interested, Buck.
<br>With no options, I was sitting at my desk, staring out the window.
<br>Woodell came and said he and his parents wanted to loan me 5k.

<br>Picking the logo.
<br>None spoke to me. I singled out a few that held out some promise and asked her to work on those.
<br>We liked this one slightly more.
<br>Looks like a wing, a whoosh of air.
<br>We all agreed it looked new, fresh and somehow ancient. Timeless.
<br>Something eye-catching about it.
<br>-
<br>Name. Falcon. Bengql. Dimension Six.
<br>If I heard one more animal name I would jump out a window.
<br>Day of decision. Canada had already started producing shoes. I needed to telex tge factory now.
<br>Johnson phoned this morning. Apparently a new name came to him in a dream. He's serious.
<br>Johnson pointed out - iconic brands -Clorox, Kleenex, Xerox - have short names (1-2 sylpabes) and strong sound in the name, like K, X, that sticks in the mind. That all described Nike. Goddess of victory. What's more important than victory?
<br>231

<br>
<br>Churchill: What's your aim? I can answer in one word. Victory.
<br>
<br>This is our moment. No more selling someone else's brand. No more working for someone else. No more late deliverirs, mixed-up orders.
<br>In the long run, we were firtunate that this had happened.

<br># There is no clean way in life
<br>Which makes it all more interesting. Work with what you have. You don't need to be 24and unempllyed
