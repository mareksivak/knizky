Mouthbreathing<br>
When the nasal cavity gets congested, airflow decreases and bacteria flourish.<br>
Causing colds and infections<br>
Congestion begets congestion, which gives us no other option but to habitually breathe from the mouth.<br>

Million years ago - atmosphere carbon dioxide - first ancestors learned to take gas in, break and spit out what was left: oxygen<br>
Took 1B years - there was enough oxygen.<br>
An ancestor that learned to gulp in oxygen and excrete co2. Oxygen produced 16x more energy than co2.<br>
Development - on ground, water, earth<br>
Plants, birds, earliest mammals<br>
Mammals grew noses to warm and purify the air, throats to guide air into lungs, and a network of sacs that would remove oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the blood.<br>
cells took oxygen from our blood and returned carbon dioxide, which traveled back through the veins, through the lungs, and into the atmosphere: the process of breathing.<br>
<br>
Perfect nasal apertures - “These are twice as large as they are today,”<br>
-<br>
They all had enormous forward-facing jaws. They had expansive sinus cavities and broad mouths. And, bizarrely, even though none of the ancient people ever flossed, or brushed, or saw a dentist, they all had straight teeth.<br>
-<br>
Wider airways - no respiratory problems - snoring, asthma<br>
Modern skills - mouth behind forehead, jaws back. All show (even ancient) show some degree of crooked teeth<br>
<br>
Why do we evolve to make us sick?<br>
Evolution is change, not mecessarily progress. Change for good or bad.<br>
We are changing in ways that have nothing to do with survival of the fittest.<br>
We are adopting and passion g by traits detrimental to our health - back aches, feet hurt, bones, breathing poorly<br>
<br>
Homo habilis - savanna's of eastern Africa- left tres, wa´ks on legs, builds tools from stones for hunting sharp enough to cut meat<br>
Tenderising meat, grilling  meat - saves effort for suggestions - saved energy grows brains<br>
<br>
Homo erectus- brain bigger twice. Growing g brain took space from airways and mouth. Muscles in the centre of the face listened, jaws thickened. and protruding nose. Vertically positioned nose less effective at filtering hair - exposing to bacteria.<br>
The more we cooked, the bigger brains, the tighter airways<br>
<br>
Homo sapiens - in cold climate - long and vertical nose to efficiently heat up the air before it entered the lungs. Lighter skin to absorb more sunshine for vitamin D production<br>
Warmer climate - wider and flatter nose - more efficient do inhaling hot and humid air. Dark skin to protect from sun<br>
Higher larynx - hlasivky - top of the throat - communication. At the back of the mouth aowing woder range re vocalisations amd volumes. smaller lips easier to manipulate<br>
<br>
Athletes<br>
Increasing I tensity of excercises. Do mouth breathing vs nosebreathing<br>
200watts - mouth cannot catch breath<br>
Nose - 3x less breaths (14 vs47) a minute, same heartbeat (intensity 10x)<br>
By nose - faster muscle recovery<br>
*The best athletes breath by nose*<br>
Train your nose for that<br>
<br>
To understand that you need to understand how body produces energy from air and food<br>
2 ways to produce energy(in cells)<br>
-without oxygen - generated with glucose - turbo boost when you have no oxygen. Inefficient, can be toxic, creates lactic acid - muscle weakness, sweating after you pushed too hard at the gym<br>
Warming up - bringing oxygen to the muscles. Otherwise needs to burn glucose - first mins of excercises are miserable<br>
Built as backup energy generator<br>
The more your muscles rely on it, the more likely they can break down - they are not built for this supply<br>
Good for short trips, bad for long hauls<br>
#<br>
<br>
-without oxygen - gives 16x more energy<br>
Your Long term  goal - stay e ergy efficient, clean burning.<br>
Use your oxygen engine for as much as possible<br>
Burns oxygen with fats<br>

Mouthbreathing, it turns out, changes the physical body and transforms airways, all for the worse.<br>
Nosebreathing - extends airways and makes breathing easier<br>
<br>
During the deepest, most restful stages of sleep, the pituitary gland, a pea-size ball at the base of the brain, secretes hormones that control the release of adrenaline, endorphins, growth hormone, +vasopressin g - which tells cells to store water - you don't feel thirsty when you sleep<br>
Lack of sleep, vasopressin abnormal - kidneys release water - need to urinate and consuˇe more liquid<br>
<br>
Mouthbreathing makes you dumber - oxygen supply on brain<br>
<br>
Imsomnia - breathing problem<br>
Leads to hyperactivity, blood pressure, cancer, diabetes<br>
<br>
breathing through the right side of the nose activates the sympathetic nervous system, the “fight or flight” mechanism that puts the body in a more elevated state of alertness and readiness.<br>
feed more blood to the opposite hemisphere of the brain, specifically to the prefrontal cortex, which has been associated with *logical decisions, language,* and computing.<br>
<br>
Left nostril breathing / rest and relax, lowers pressure, cools body, *reduces anxiety*<br>
Left-nostril breathing shifts blood flow to the opposite side of the prefrontal cortex, to the area that influences creative thought and plays a role in the formation of mental abstractions<br>

Extend lung capacity<br>
-key to longevity<br>
*Five Tibetan Rites,*<br>
involves a lot of stretching: back bends, neck bends, and twirling, each one a holy and ancient practice that had been passed down in secrecy from one Buddhist monk to another for 2,500 years.<br>
Just a few minutes of daily bending and breathing can expand lung capacity. With that extra capacity we can expand our lives.<br>
<br>

<br>
Longevity - most important factor Lung capacity. Then genetics, diets, excercise.<br>
*The smaller and lessefficient lungs, the easier to get sick - the shorter life*<br>
<br>
Lung capacity degrades with age<br>
30-50 12percent<br>
30-80 30 percent<br>
Bones in the chest would become thinner and change shape, causing rib cages to collapse inward. Muscle fibers surrounding the lungs would weaken and prevent air from entering and exiting.<br>
<br>
Good news - The internal organs are malleable, and we can change them at nearly any time.<br>
You can increase your capacity by 40percent!<br>

Katharine Schroth<br>
Recovered herself from scoliosis - incurable curved spine<br>
-<br>
Schroth had other thoughts about the human body’s potential. She’d watched how balloons collapsed or expanded, pushing or pulling in whatever was around them. The lungs, she felt, were no different. If she could expand her lungs, maybe she could also expand her skeletal structure. Maybe she could straighten her spine and improve the quality and quantity of her life.<br>
-<br>
She would stand in front of a mirror, twist her body, and inhale into one lung while limiting air intake to the other. Then she’d hobble over to a table, sling her body on its side, and arch her chest back and forth to loosen her rib cage while breathing into the empty space. Schroth spent five years doing this. <br>
<br>
--Remember to make change by force of will<br>
Teach yourself to breath in way that changes other organs of your body<br>
<br>
Blood circulation<br>
average of 2,000 gallons of blood a day. This regular and consistent blood flow is essential to delivering fresh oxygenated blood to cells and removing waste.<br>
-<br>
As we inhale, negative pressure draws blood into the heart; as we exhale, blood shoots back out into the body and lungs, where it recirculates.<br>
-<br>
And what powers the thoracic pump is the diaphragm, the *muscle that sits beneath the lungs in the shape of an umbrella*. The diaphragm lifts during exhalations, which shrinks the lungs, then it drops back down to expand them during inhalations.<br>
<br>
Engage 10 percent of umbrella muscle - overburdens heart, increase blood pressure<br>
Extending breaths to 50-70 body works efficiently<br>
<br>
Pacients breathing on 1 percent - lie straight on back, slowlu´y inhale and exhale<br>
<br>
Our bodies can survive on short breaths for decades, and many of us do. That doesn’t mean it’s good for us.<br>
<br>
Toextend lungs- happens during *exhalation*<br>
when the amount of air that enters us equals the amount that leaves, and our bodies are able perform all their essential functions with the least exertion.<br>
count from one to ten over and over with every exhale. “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10—then keep repeating it,”<br>
“Get out the last little molecule of air!”<br>
“Keep moving your lips!”<br>
*Power of full exhalation*<br>
<br>
Athletes<br>
Most of them *breathed way too often, high* in their chests. Sprinters were the worst off. The short and violent breaths they took during runs put too much pressure on delicate tissues and bronchial tubes. As a result, they suffered from asthma and other respiratory ailments.<br>
-<br>
He warned them to never hold their breath when positioned at the starting line at the beginning of a race, but to *breathe deeply and calmly* and always exhale at the sound of the starter pistol. This way, the first breath they’d take in would be rich and full and provide them with energy to run faster and longer.<br>

SLOW BREATHING<br>
paced breathing relaxed the body and calmed the mind.<br>
<br>
“Breathing heavy, breathing quickly and as deeply as you can—I realized this is the worst advice anyone could give you,” Olsson told me. Big, heavy breaths were bad for us because they depleted our bodies of, yes, carbon dioxide.<br>
<br>
/He had the kind of calm you see in monks/, Amish, and others who spend a lot of time in their inner worlds. <br>
When he spoke, it was always softly, and with that annoying habit that all Scandinavians seem to have inherited: flawless English, with no umms or huhs or pauses.<br>
<br>
What many of these doctors found, and what Olsson would discover much later, was that the best way to prevent many chronic health problems, improve athletic performance, and extend longevity was to focus on how we breathed, specifically to *balance oxygen and carbon dioxide levels* in the body. To do this, we’d need to learn how to *inhale and exhale slowly.*<br>
<br>
How could doing less give us more?<br>
<br>
Breath entering lungs<br>
Ends on alveoli - a docking station where blood will pick it up<br>
-<br>
As blood passes through muscles, oxygen will disembark, providing fuel to hungry cells. As oxygen offloads, other passengers, namely carbon dioxide—the “waste product” of metabolism—will pile aboard,<br>
-<br>
One roundtrip takes 1 minute<br>
<br>
That carbon dioxide in every exhale has weight, and we exhale more weight than we inhale.<br>
*We lose weight through exhaled breath.*<br>
85percent weightless, rest sweat and urine<br>
<br>
muscles used during exercise received more oxygen than lesser-used muscles. They were producing more carbon dioxide, which attracted more oxygen.<br>
<br>
Rapid and panicked breaths<br>
Purge co2<br>
Reduced blood flow to muscles - inconsistent blood flow - feel light headed, headache, etc<br>
<br>
If you are *overbreathing*, no more oxygen is co sumed than needed - oxygen bars are useless. No more co2 is roduced. <br>
*No benefit*, can create oxygen deficit and relative suffocation<br>
<br>
Restore health - breathe SLOWLY<br>
<br>
By taking longer breaths, we allow our lungs to soak up more in fewer breaths.<br>
<br>
Breath slowly. Very slowly.<br>
In - nose, out - mouth<br>
Oxygen leveler same or increase, co2 in blood increases<br>
<br>
Average 18 breaths a minute -- to 6<br>
<br>
With training you can perform 16 breaths instead of 46<br>
<br>
“When you see yourself running faster every day, with your breath rate stable . . . you will begin to feel the true meaning of the word fitness.”<br>
<br>
Cycling<br>
We felt lungs desperately trying to get oxygen to cells<br>
Normally, I’d open my mouth and huff and puff, trying to sate that nagging need for oxygen.<br>
Now - I cranked the pedals harder and faster, I forced myself to breathe softer and slower.<br>
We use only a quarter of oxygen we breathe<br>
<br>
Use slow breathing to break your athletic records<br>
<br>
Fast breathing -- feeling air hunger immediately<br>

“resonant breathing” or Coherent Breathing. The technique required no real effort, time, or thoughtfulness. And we could do it anywhere, at any time. “It’s totally private,” wrote Gerbarg. “Nobody knows you are doing it<br>
<br>
Same benefits as meditation<br>
<br>
BREATHE LESS<br>
<br>
Indian Yogi's are trained to breathe less<br>
Tiberian monks too - calm and reduce<br>
Chinese - prescribed less than 10 breaths per min<br>
<br>
The key to optimum breathing, and all the health, endurance, and longevity benefits that come with it, is to practice *fewer* *inhales and exhales in a smaller volume*. To breathe, but to breathe less.<br>
<br>
Breathing less - same benefits as fasting<br>
Occasionally leads to euphoria.<br>
<br>
Jogging<br>
The key is to find a rhythm that works for you.<br>
<br>
Slower, *longer exhales*, of course, mean *higher carbon dioxide levels*. With that bonus carbon dioxide, we gain a higher aerobic endurance.<br>
<br>
Buteyko - examined objects from the world around him<br>
He came to view the world as a mechanism, and everything within it as a collection of parts locking together to form a greater whole.<br>
<br>
he noticed that patients in the worst health all seemed to breathe far too much.<br>
<br>
Breathing normal like he would finished a workout. Noticed this is a terminal state for patients<br>
He tried an experiment. He *started breathing less, to relax his chest and stomach* and sip air through his nose.<br>
A few mins later - pain disappeared.<br>
Stopped - Within only five inhales, the pain returned.<br>
<br>
Breathing just 20 percent, or even 10 percent more than the body’s needs could overwork our systems. Eventually, they’d weaken<br>
<br>
Recovered asthma attack<br>
Buteyko approached and showed him the technique he’d been using on himself. After a few minutes, the patient calmed down. He inhaled a careful and clear breath through his nose and then calmly exhaled.<br>
<br>
Extreme version<br>
We were limiting our inhales while extending exhales far past the point of what feels comfortable, or even safe. We’re sweating and red faced<br>
Get the body comfprts´able with higher levels co2<br>
Make unconsciously breathe less - release more O2, increase endurance, better support body functions<br>
<br>
“Breathe out twice as long for each inhale, three times,”<br>
Going to puke? That's it! Even slower, even less!<br>
<br>
Buteyko was fascinated with carbon dioxide, and he too believed that increasing this gas by breathing less could not only keep us fit and healthy. It could heal us as well.<br>
<br>
Some reported heat in hands and toes<br>
Those already in good health felt even better. Athletes claimed big gains in performance.<br>

He never wanted to run. When shoe company nomi nated him for a local race, he wanted to find an excuse. He finished 2/100.<br>
<br>
Zátopek developed his own training methods to give himself an edge. *He’d run as fast as he could holding his breath, take a few huffs and puffs* and then do it all again. It was an extreme version of Buteyko’s methods,<br>
<br>
Won 5k,10k gold. Decided to run a marathon, although he never run a one. He won gold.<br>
<br>
“He does everything wrong but win,” said Larry Snyder, a track coach at Ohio State<br>
<br>
🏊<br>
Swimming<br>
swimmers usually take two or three strokes before they flip their heads to the side and inhale. Counsilman trained his team to hold their breath for as many as nine strokes. He believed that, over time, the swimmers would utilize oxygen more efficiently and swim faster.-<br>
They won 13 gold medals, 14 silver, and 7 bronze, and they set world records in 11 events.<br>
<br>
Critics were all wrong. They’d been looking at athletes holding their breath with *full lungs, and all that extra air in the lungs made it difficult* for the athletes to enter into a deep state of hypoventilation. (Under-)<br>
<br>
Asthma<br>
-medicine has dangerous side effect - includes life shortening<br>
Many of them have trained themselves to breathe less and reported dramatic improvement.<br>
<br>
Hyperventilation<br>
“In essence they are taking in too much air. But the sensation that they get is shortness of breath, choking, air hunger, as if they’re not getting enough air.<br>
<br>
Butyenko<br>
He was convinced that heart disease, hemorrhoids, gout, cancer, and more than 100 other diseases were all caused by carbon dioxide deficiency brought on by overbreathing. <br>
<br>
/The core Buteyko exercises involve breath control: consciously reducing either breathing rate or breathing volume.[9] <br>
as 'breathing retraining' and compare the method to learning to ride a bicycle. Once time has been spent practicing, the techniques become instinctive/<br>
<br>
Butyenko methods<br>
how they all “cured” themselves with nothing more than breathing less. The techniques they used varied, but all circled around the same premise: to extend the length of time between inhalations and exhalations.<br>
<br>
Mammals - with low resting heart rates live the longest<br>
Breathe the slowest - retain slow resting heart rate<br>
<br>
“The yogi’s life is not measured by the number of his days, but the number of his breaths,” wrote B. K. S. Iyengar, an Indian yoga teacher who had spent years in bed as a sickly child until he learned yoga and breathed himself back to health. He died in 2014, at age 95.<br>
<br>
CHEWING<br>
12k years ago - first farming<br>
Within a few generations of eating industrialised and farmed foods, humans became the worst breathers. Such a dramatic change<br>
<br>
Industrial revolution - people spent whole lives eating processed foods - nothing fresh, nothing raw, nothing natural - canned, bottled, preservants<br>
No fibres, vitamins, minerals, amino acids.<br>
Human population grew sicker<br>
<br>
Societies that replaced their traditional diets with modern foods suffered cavities, crooked teeth, obstructed airways - poor health<br>
Modern diets - white flour, white rice, jams, canned veggies, processed meats<br>
<br>
Vitamins work in symbiosis - you need all to talk effect - supplements don't have them<br>
<br>
Change is not about vitamins - is about chewing<br>
Modern foods are healthy but soft<br>
Our ancient ancestors chewed for hours a day, every day. And because they chewed so much, their mouths, teeth, throats, and faces grew to be wide and strong and pronounced.<br>
<br>
Thicker necks cramp airways. - 17 inches - snoring, sleep apnea<br>
The smaller the mouth is, the more the tongue, uvula, and other tissues can obstruct airflow.<br>
<br>
When sitting or standing, the *spine should form a J-shape—perfectly straight until it reaches the small of the back*, where it naturally curves outward. While maintaining this posture, we should always breathe slowly through the nose into the abdomen. Our bodies and airways are designed to work best in this posture, both Mews agreed. *Look at any Greek statue*, or a drawing by Leonardo, or an ancient portrait. Everyone<br>
Many people have hunched shoulders, S-shaped spine<br>
<br>

<br>
Heartbeat - use breathing techniques to calm down<br>
<br>
long and slow breaths are so relaxing. As molecules of breath descend deeper, they switch on parasympathetic nerves (nerves in lungs - control feelings), which send more messages for the organs to rest and digest. <br>
<br>
The deeper and more softly we breathe in, and the longer we exhale, the more slowly the heart beats and the calmer we become.<br>
*Chill out*<br>
<br>
Sympathetic states<br>
In these states, the body redirects blood flow from less-vital organs like the stomach and bladder and sends it to the muscles and brain. Heart rate increases, adrenaline kicks in, blood vessels constrict, mind sharpens<br>
we can fight harder or run faster when confronted with danger.<br>
Our bodies are built to stay in these states for short occasions<br>

<br>
I want to condition myself so I can remain flexible to the constant pressures of modern life.<br>
Professional surfers, mixed martial arts fighters, and Navy SEALs use Tummo-style breathing to get into the zone before a competition Or mission<br>
<br>
methods of *breathing slow, less, through the nose with a big exhale,* can also diffuse stress and restore balance. These techniques can be life-changing, and I’d seen dozens of people changed by them.<br>

Win Hof<br>
He had sought refuge from his pain by deepening his practice of yoga, meditation, and breathing practices.<br>
He simplified and promoted Tunmo<br>
<br>
Hof submerged himself in a bath filled with ice for an hour and 52 minutes, and he suffered no hypothermia or frostbite. Then he ran a full marathon in the Namib desert in temperatures that reached 104, without ever sipping a drop of water.<br>
<br>
Hof insisted he wasn't special. just breathe<br>
<br>
I do as instructed, and listen as the rushing wind that was pouring through my lungs suddenly stops and is replaced by pure silence, the kind of jarring quietude a skydiver feels the moment a parachute opens. But this stillness is coming from inside. As I hold my breath longer, I feel a comforting *heat spread across my body and face.* I focus on my heart, rock to its vibrations.<br>
“Make the silence between your heartbeats last an eternity,”<br>
take in a huge breath without exhaling, and to hold it again for 15 seconds, gently moving the air around my chest. Exhale and start cycle again <br>
<br>
Men, mainly in their 20s, who’d suddenly been diagnosed with arthritis and psoriasis or depression, who, weeks after practicing heavy breathing, no longer suffered any symptoms.<br>
<br>
To practice *Wim Hof’s breathing method*, start by finding a quiet place and lying flat on your back with a pillow under your head. Relax the shoulders, chest, and legs. Take a very deep breath into the pit of your stomach and let it back out just as quickly. Keep breathing this way for 30 cycles.<br>
Each breath should look like a wave, with the inhale inflating the stomach, then the chest. You should exhale all the air out in the same order.<br>
At the end of 30 breaths, exhale to the natural conclusion, leaving about a quarter of the air left in the lungs, then hold that breath for as long as possible. Once you’ve reached your breathhold limit, take one huge inhale and hold it another 15 seconds. Very gently, move that fresh breath of air around the chest and to the shoulders, then exhale and start the heavy breathing again. Repeat the whole pattern three or four rounds and add in some cold exposure (cold shower, ice bath, naked snow angels) a few times a week.<br>
breathing all-out, then not at all,getting really cold and then hot again—is the key to Tummo’s magic. It forces the body into high stress one minute, a state of extreme relaxation<br>
Tissues become oxygen deficient and then flooded again. The body becomes more adaptable and flexible<br>
<br>
Before Wim Hof, he immersed himself in ice from the neck down and sat there motionless for 55 minutes.<br>

Create a state of stress toaccess conscious and unconscious thoughts<br>

State of groovy calm<br>
<br>
Sometimes patients might vomit or suffer nervous breakdowns. If they got through all that, mystical visions, spiritual awakenings, psychological breakthroughs, out-of-body experiences, and, sometimes, what Grof called a “mini life-death-rebirth” could follow.<br>
<br>
Grof believed experiences were triggered by having less oxygen in the brain.<br>
<br>
Whenever the body is forced to take in more air than it needs, we’ll exhale too much carbon dioxide, which will narrow the blood vessels and decrease circulation, especially in the brain. With just a few minutes, or even seconds, of overbreathing, brain blood flow can decrease by 40 percent,<br>
Most affected areas - visual procedsing., Sensoring, memory<br>
If we breath faster, and deeper, more blood will drain from brain, visual and auditorial hallucinations will become profound<br>
Sensations of death and rebirth - constantly sustaining stress signals may get body think it's dying<br>
<br>
When we breath slowly, co2 levels will rise<br>
-our receptors will send signals to breathe faster - even deeper nervous system than the one recognizing fear or danger<br>
When we breath fast, these receptors send signals to slow down to increase co2 levels<br>
By training chemoreceptors you can withstand diving for 10mins, become a great athlete or summit Mt Everest without oxygen<br>
<br>
Control - fears, anxiety, panic - train brain to become flexible to CO2 levels - practice the art of holding breath<br>

Chinese breathholding manuscript<br>
-cut off thoughts, block breath. Breath by nose, exhale by mouth<br>
Do not let it be audible. Let it be fine and subtle<br>
Blocking the breath will make your feet perspire<br>
Count 100x one and two.<br>
After blocking the breath to the extreme, exhale it subtly<br>
If you feel hot, say Ho<br>
If you feel cold, say Ch'ui<br>
*Breathe like this amd count to 1000, you will need no grains and medicine*<br>

We remain in state of perpetual distraction - cannot fully focus<br>

Super Endurance<br>
The most effective and safest blend they found was a few huffs of around 7 percent carbon dioxide mixed with room air.<br>
-no hallucinogenic effects - hardly notice, potential results<br>
“Holy fuck! . . . I was breathing . . . and I started to feel fricking AMAZing. Euphoric even.<br>
<br>
These monks don’t huff and puff. Instead, they sit cross-legged and *breathe slow and less,* inducing a state of extreme relaxation and calm, reducing their metabolic rates by as much as 64 percent—<br>
The monks should be dead, or at least suffering from extreme hypothermia. However, in this very relaxed state, they’re able to increase body temperature by double digits and stay steaming hot in sub-zero temperatures for hours.<br>

Prana (India)<br>
*Qi*<br>
-ancient theory of atoms<br>
Objects - they’re all made of swirling atomic bits. It’s energy. It’s prana.<br>
Qi - believed the body contained channels that functioned like prana power lines connecting<br>
The more prana something has, the more alive it is. Should this flow of energy ever become blocked, the body would shut down and sickness would follow. If we lose so much prana that we can’t support basic body functions, we die.<br>
They created acupuncture to open up prana channels and yoga postures to awaken and distribute the energy.<br>
Spicy foods - large dieses of prana - Chinese and Indian foods traditionally spicy<br>
<br>
But the most powerful technique was to *inhale prana: to breathe*. Breathing techniques were so fundamental to prana<br>
When we breathe, we expand our life force. The<br>

Swami Rama<br>
Rama exhaled, calmed himself, lowered his thick eyelids, and then began breathing, carefully controlling the air entering and exiting his body.<br>
the brain waves identified with deep sleep.<br>
When he “woke up,” he gave a detailed recap of the conversation in the room<br>
He said - mind was active while the “brain slept.”<br>
He moved his focus from breath to heart and stopped his heart for 30s<br>
Nothing superhuman - standard practices of Indian yogis<br>
<br>
Rama revealed some of his secrets of prana control in group lessons and videos.<br>
removing the pause between inhalations and exhalations so that every breath was one line connected with no end.<br>
Lengthen breaths<br>
<br>
lie down, take a brief inhale, and then exhale to a count of 6. As they progressed, they could inhale to a count of 4 and exhale to 8, with the goal of reaching a half-minute exhale after six months of practice. Upon *reaching this 30 count*, Rama promised his students, they “*will not have any toxins and will be disease-free.*”<br>

Albert Szent-Györgyi,<br>
Nobel price for Vitamic C<br>
proposed an explanation for the subtle energy that drives all life and everything else in the universe. “All living organisms are but leaves on the same tree of life,”<br>
“The various functions of plants and animals and their specialized organs are manifestations of the same living matter.”<br>
--<br>
Animosity - The more easily and often electrons can be transferred between molecules, the more “desaturated” matter becomes, the more alive it is.<br>
-<br>
Oxygen was a strong electron acceptor.<br>
*The more oxygen life can consume,* the more electron excitability it gains, the more animated it becomes.<br>
-<br>
When cells lose ability to absorb electrons, they begin break down<br>
Affect free electron interchange and cells start growing abnormally - rusting - cancer.<br>
*Cancers develop in environment with low oxygen*<br>
-<br>
*Breathing slow, less*, and through the nose *balances the levels of respiratory gases* - sends maximum amount of oxygen to the maximum amount of cells<br>

Old Yoga<br>
<br>
The earliest yoga was a science of holding still and building prana through breathing.<br>
<br>
Yoga classes in Indus valley - dirty classroom, villagers attending<br>
The classes were casual and the relationship between students and teachers was respectful, yet light. Teachers joked with students during exercises; students joked back. “Push yourself!” the instructors would yell in gruff and direct voices. “You can do better than that!” <br>
<br>
Postures wete held for long time<br>
*These long postures allowed students to focus entirely on their breathing.*<br>
Nothing like yoga today<br>
<br>
Ancient yoga, and its focus on prana, sitting, and breathing, has turned into a form of aerobic exercise.<br>
<br>
original practices as “Yôga” (pronounced yoooooga), which comes from the ancient Niríshwarasámkhya lineage,<br>
Yôga practices were never designed to cure problems, he tells me. They were created for healthy people to climb the next rung of potential: to give them the conscious power to heat themselves on command, expand their consciousness, control their nervous systems and hearts, and live longer and more vibrant lives.<br>
<br>
Kryia<br>
I had practiced an ancient pranayama technique called Sudarshan Kriya and was quickly floored.<br>
It does much of what Tummo<br>
-<br>
Purifying Breath, requires more than 40 minutes of intensive breathing, from huffing and at a rate of more than a hundred breaths per minute, to several minutes of slow breathing, and then hardly breathing at all. Rinse and repeat.<br>
-<br>
*extreme sweating, complete loss of time, and lightness* I felt for days afterward.<br>
<br>
The key to Sudarshan Kriya, Tummo, or any other breathing practice rooted in ancient yoga is to learn to be patient, maintain flexibility, and slowly absorb what breathing has to offer.<br>
<br>
I relax my throat and take a very deep inhale into the pit of my stomach, then exhale completely. Inhale again, and repeat.<br>
-<br>
The wave comes, washes over and runs up, then turns around and recedes, back to the ocean.<br>
<br>
Doctors told me<br>
Modern medicine is good at fixing emergencies, but deficient at treating milder diseases - asthma, headaches, stress, autoimmune - issues of modern world<br>
Diabetes, hearth problems - created by food and how we live<br>
<br>

Exhale<br>
Stough - get all the air out of our bodies so that we could take more in. He trained his clients to exhale longer and, in the process, do what had long been considered biologically impossible. Emphysemics reported almost total recovery from their incurable conditions, opera singers gained more resonance and tone in their voices, asthmatics no longer suffered from attacks, and Olympic sprinters went on to win gold medals.<br>
<br>
Most of us engage only a small fraction of our total lung capacity with each breath, requiring us to do more and get less. <br>
<br>
“The difference in breathing in the coordinated pattern and in an altered pattern is the difference between operating at peak efficiency and just getting along,” Stough wrote in the 1960s.<br>
<br>
Chew<br>
strong jaws, and straight teeth. Almost all humans born before 300 years ago shared these traits because they chewed a lot.<br>
*we can influence the size and shape of our mouths and improve our ability to breathe* at virtually any age.<br>
Don't follow diets - soft foods. Your diet should consist of the rougher, rawer, and heartier foods<br>
<br>
*Breathe more, on occasion*<br>
Feeding the body more air than it needs is damaging for the lungs right down to the cellular level. Today, the majority of us breathe more than we should, without realizing it.<br>
*Willing yourself to breathe heavily for a short, intense time, however, can be profoundly therapeutic.*<br>
*Tummo*, Sudarshan Kriya, and vigorous pranayamas do. They stress the body on purpose, snapping it out of its funk so that it can properly function during the other 23½ hours a day. Conscious heavy breathing teaches us to be the pilots of our autonomic nervous systems and our bodies, not the passengers.<br>
<br>
overbreathing in an effort to keep their carbon dioxide as low as possible.<br>

Our talks are never dull. “I have more energy and focus than ever in my life!” he told me, right after celebrating his 50th birthday.<br>

BREATHING METHODS<br>
<br>
mrjamesnestor.com/breath.<br>
<br>
(NADI SHODHANA)<br>
Lower stress, heart rate and blood pressure<br>
Practice before meeting or sleep<br>
<br>
RESONANT BREATHING<br>
To calm down<br>
- 5.5s inhale, 5.5s exhale - each cycle should be like a circle<br>
- Repeat at least 10 times<br>
I try this as often as possible<br>
Apps can help you track<br>

<br>
BUTEYKO methods<br>
Buteyko had an arsenal of methods, and almost all of them are based on extending the time between inhalations and exhalations, or breathholding.<br>
<br>
--Control pause<br>
Close nose, exhale<br>
Measure time until you need to take breath - naturally. Don't force yourself. If you gasp breathhold was too long<br>
Never do after excercises or at stressed - you should be relaxed<br>
-you may bevome dizzey, be careful of injury<br>
<br>
--Minibreatholds<br>
A key component to Buteyko breathing is to practice breathing less all the time, which is what this technique trains the body to do.<br>
Stave off asthma and anxiety<br>
-exhale and hold breath for half of Control pause (if control pause is 40, hold for 20)<br>
-repeat 100-500 times a day<br>
You can setup timers as reminders<br>
<br>
-- Nose Songs<br>
Nitric oxide - increase oxygenization, relaxes muscles<br>
Humming increase release of nitric oxide in nasal passages 15fold<br>
Breathe normally through the nose and hum, any song or sound. Practice for at least five minutes a day, more if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hypoventilation - jogging at Golden Gate Park<br>
<br>
<br>
--Running, Walking<br>
Walk or run for a minute or so while breathing normally through the nose. Exhale and pinch the nose closed while keeping the same pace. <br>
When you sense a palpable air hunger, release the nose and breathe very gently, at about half of what feels normal for about 10 to 15 seconds. Return to regular breathing for 30 seconds. <br>
Repeat for about ten cycles.<br>
<br>
--Decongest the nose<br>
Hold breath<br>
Once you feel a very potent sense of air hunger, take a very slow and controlled breath in through the nose. (If the nose is still congested, breathe softly through the mouth with pursed lips.) Continue this calm, controlled breathing for at least 30 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat all these steps six times.<br>
<br>
TUMMO<br>
30 deep fast breaths<br>
-The movement of each inhalation should look like a wave, filling up in the stomach and softly moving up through the lungs. Exhales follow the same movement, first emptying the stomach then the chest as air pours through the nose<br>
-are the end - leave about a quarter of the air in the lungs. Hold that breath for as long as possible.<br>
-Once you’ve reached your absolute breathhold limit, take one huge inhale and hold it another 15 seconds.<br>
-then exhale and start the heavy breathing again. Repeat the entire pattern at least three times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SUDARSHAN KRIYA<br>
This is the most powerful technique I’ve learned, and one of the most involved and difficult to get through. Sudarshan Kriya consists of four phases: Om chants, breath restriction, paced breathing (inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, exhaling for 6, then holding for 2), and, finally, 40 minutes of very heavy breathing.<br>
<br>
Wim Hof - parasympathetic response<br>
<br>
BOXBREATHING<br>
Navy SEALs use this technique to stay calm and focused in tense situations. It’s simple. <br>
-<br>
Inhale to a count of 4; hold 4; exhale 4; hold 4. Repeat. <br>
*Longer exhalations will elicit a stronger parasympathetic response.* <br>
A variation of Box Breathing to more deeply relax the body that’s especially effective before sleeping is as follows: <br>
-<br>
Inhale to a count of 4; hold 4; exhale 6; hold 2. <br>
Repeat.<br>
-<br>
Try for 6 rounds<br>
<br>
BREATHHOLD WALKING<br>
Anders Olsson uses this technique to increase carbon dioxide and, thus, increase circulation in his body. It’s not much fun, but the benefits, Olsson told me, are many. <br>
Exhale all the breath, then walk slowly, counting each step. <br>
Once you feel a powerful sense of air hunger, stop counting and take a few very calm breaths through the nose while still walking. <br>
Breathe normally for at least a minute, then repeat the sequence. <br>
-<br>
The more you practice this technique, the higher the count. *Olsson’s record is 130 steps*; mine is about a third of that.<br>
<br>
4-7-8 BREATHING <br>
This technique, made famous by Dr. Andrew Weil, places the body into a state of deep relaxation. <br>
I use it on long flights to *help fall asleep.* <br>
Take a breath in, then exhale through your mouth with a whoosh sound. <br>
Close the mouth and *inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four. Hold for a count of seven.* <br>
*Exhale* completely through your mouth, with a whoosh, *to the count of eight.* <br>
Repeat this cycle for at least four breaths.
