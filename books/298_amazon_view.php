<br>
<br>1. Obsession with customer
<br>
<br>Leaders at Amazon start with the customer and work backwards, seeking continually to earn and keep the customer’s trust.  Although leaders pay attention to their competitors, they obsess  over their customers.

<br>
<br>Put yourself in your customers position, develop their needs and meet them better that anyone has ever done.
<br>
<br>Best CS - no CS - happens when customer never asks for help.
<br>
<br>Early in the internet revolution - the biggest threat to customer experience are people involved. Frictionless experiemce - minimize human involvement rhrough innovation and tech (self order and track).
<br>Mimimize time your talented people need to do routime ops, free tuem to innovate to delight customer in new ways.
<br>
<br>The more frictionless experience, the lower control costs - this includes marekting and advertising
<br>- Free shipping: for orders above 100usd - i stead of advertising amazon pumped money into free shipping, what created word of mouth, the most effective form of advertising
<br>- sacrofoce short term financials for customers benefit, strategy drove long term comletitive and financial benefit.
<br>
<br>Fractal maths - patterns in nature have tencency to repeat themselves at different scales
<br>
<br>Going online - doubted that customers need to try products first. Won over on giving enough info and frictionless return process 
<br>
<br>Holy Trinity - price, selection, availability - durable and universal customers needs
<br>Offer everything, make it cheaper, make it more easily available.
<br>Jeff: I cannot imagine a day customer would want higher prices, less selection and more complicated transaction process.

<br>
<br>Availability.
<br>Apple failed to deliver 4k ipods before Christmas. Other company would apologize customers and let it go.
<br>Amazon - we ruined peoples Christmas because of lack of availability - under any circumstances. So we bought them at retail,  repacked and sold. It killed our margin, but we kept our promise
<br>J: try to get our money back from Apple.
<br>They split the cost. Even if not, right thing to do.
<br>- disappoint customer - hazard with trust
<br>#
<br>
<br>Andon cord, emergency break - originated in manufacture, stopping assembly line - risk of compromising quality or health
<br>Incomplete product descriptions - disapoint customer, will ask for return
<br>We gave folks in retail action items to fix. No change though.
<br>Brzda - when customers complain about a problem with product, we take it down and message retailer - fix the defect or you cant sell.
<br>-- underscores obsession with customer

<br>
<br>J: Bring empty chair to the meetings - ensure voice of customer is heard althoug not physically present
<br>To ensure voice of customer is heard throught organisation - all managers 2 days at CS every year
<br>
<br>Jeff: invested millions into systems montiroting online customer feedback
<br>- email system monitoring CS conversations
<br>- metrics to track customer complaints

<br>J: 2 ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you’re  good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what  your customers need and work backward, even if it requires  learning new skills.

<br>2. TAKE OWNERSHIP
<br>
<br>Think long term, dont sacrifice long term value for short term results -- bad leadership
<br>#
<br>
<br>Sell your long term idea
<br>- look in opportunities in multiple years and decades
<br>- buying Washington Post may not be that crazy then

<br>No tolerance to excuses and bullshit
<br>- Failed project report: here's what didnt work, why and how ee're going to change
<br>- Project heading to disaster: we dont think its going to work, lets try sth else.
<br>
<br>J: hard to work with. Danded too much, stingy with praise. A lot accomplished.
<br>
<br>Ownership - not only mastering your domain, go beyond your role whenever its needed to improve customer experience or fix problrm.
<br>
<br>If you've got something valuable dont wait to be asked, simply show up.
<br>Talk with knowldge and aithority about projects 3 levels  far  from you
