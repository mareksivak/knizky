<br>
<br>Reinvent customer experience and perfect technologies that would make it possible

<br>
<br>Build at least one-year old plan: 
<br>how will we get better? 
<br>What does customer want from us?
<br>How can we use new technology to improve customer experience?

<br>As a potential leader you are expectedto record concrete examples of how you embodied 14 principles and you will be rigorously evaluated upon them.
<br>
<br>Easy to understand, difficult to proceed
<br>
<br>Clarity 
<br>- not only about what you decide, but also how precisely
<br>
<br>----
<br>
<br>1. Obsession with customer
<br>
<br>Leaders at Amazon start with the customer and work backwards, seeking continually to earn and keep the customer’s trust.  Although leaders pay attention to their competitors, they obsess  over their customers.
<br>#
<br>- has created organisation whose actions are based upon specific philosophy and consistent values
<br>
<br>Put yourself in your customers position, develop their needs and meet them better that anyone has ever done.
<br>
<br>Best CS - no CS - happens when customer never asks for help.
<br>
<br>Early in the internet revolution - the biggest threat to customer experience are people involved. Frictionless experiemce - minimize human involvement rhrough innovation and tech (self order and track).
<br>Mimimize time your talented people need to do routime ops, free tuem to innovate to delight customer in new ways.
<br>
<br>The more frictionless experience, the lower control costs - this includes marekting and advertising
<br>- Free shipping: for orders above 100usd - i stead of advertising amazon pumped money into free shipping, what created word of mouth, the most effective form of advertising
<br>- sacrofoce short term financials for customers benefit, strategy drove long term comletitive and financial benefit.
<br>
<br>Fractal maths - patterns in nature have tencency to repeat themselves at different scales
<br>
<br>Going online - doubted that customers need to try products first. Won over on giving enough info and frictionless return process 
<br>
<br>Holy Trinity - price, selection, availability - durable and universal customers needs
<br>Offer everything, make it cheaper, make it more easily available.
<br>Jeff: I cannot imagine a day customer would want higher prices, less selection and more complicated transaction process.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Word of moth becomes tve most customer aquisition tool we have -- build and keep trust
<br>
<br>Maximize margins when limited offer outside
<br>J: would backfire. Leaves bitter tastes at customer with assiciates with brand.
<br>
<br>Amazon: a store for virtually anything you can buy. Started with books then expamded everywhere

<br>
<br>Availability.
<br>Apple failed to deliver 4k ipods before Christmas. Other company would apologize customers and let it go.
<br>Amazon - we ruined peoples Christmas because of lack of availability - under any circumstances. So we bought them at retail,  repacked and sold. It killed our margin, but we kept our promise
<br>J: try to get our money back from Apple.
<br>They split the cost. Even if not, right thing to do.
<br>- disappoint customer - hazard with trust
<br>#
<br>
<br>Andon cord, emergency break - originated in manufacture, stopping assembly line - risk of compromising quality or health
<br>Incomplete product descriptions - disapoint customer, will ask for return
<br>We gave folks in retail action items to fix. No change though.
<br>Brzda - when customers complain about a problem with product, we take it down and message retailer - fix the defect or you cant sell.
<br>-- underscores obsession with customer
<br>#
<br>
<br>J: Bring empty chair to the meetings - ensure voice of customer is heard althoug not physically present
<br>To ensure voice of customer is heard throught organisation - all managers 2 days at CS every year
<br>
<br>Jeff: invested millions into systems montiroting online customer feedback
<br>- email system monitoring CS conversations
<br>- metrics to track customer complaints
<br>- fulfillment capacity for merchants
<br>"We built automated systems that look for occasions when we provided cust experiemce that is not up to our standards and proactively refund - ef video stram quality"

<br>
<br>2. TAKE OWNERSHIP
<br>
<br>Think long term, dont sacrifice long term value for short term results -- bad leadership
<br>#
<br>
<br>Sell your long term idea
<br>- look in opportunities in multiple years and decades
<br>- buying Washington Post may not be that crazy then
<br>##
<br>
<br>Amazon culture: Reward poeple passionate about ideas and own results.
<br>
<br>Highest level of customer service is impossible without high level of accountability and willingness to be open, direct and honesy.
<br>No tolerance to excuses and bullshit
<br>- Failed project report: here's what didnt work, why and how ee're going to change
<br>- Project heading to disaster: we dont think its going to work, lets try sth else.
<br>
<br>J: hard to work with. Danded too much, stingy with praise. A lot accomplished.
<br>
<br>Ownership - not only mastering your domain, go beyond your role whenever its needed to improve customer experience or fix problrm.
<br>
<br>If you've got something valuable dont wait to be asked, simply show up.
<br>Talk with knowldge and authority about projects 3 levels  far  from you
<br>
<br>----



<br>3. Understanding metrics and dependencies 
<br>
<br>
<br>•  Go three degrees deeper than normal
<br>
<br>You own your dependencies - you must be able to say: I did these things to manage my dependencies. 
<br>
<br>Incentivise leadership by designing compensation plans that reward it
<br>
<br>J: We know our success will be affected by our ability to attract and retain motivated employee base. Each of them must think like and be an owner.
<br>
<br>Mentality shifts
<br>
<br>——-
<br>
<br>4.  Innovate and simplify
<br>
<br>When process is automated, it’s easier to scale and measure. 
<br>
<br>Platform as a Self-service *
<br>— speeds up innovation. Even improbable ideas can be tried. In many cases they work
<br>
<br>Platform as an enabler - build virtuous cycles that circulate and expand energy
<br>
<br>Technology makes platform possible
<br>
<br>Willingness to rethink rules and policies is critical for business to succeed.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Instead pf thinking how to reduce friction by 10 percent, push for being more radical - challenge status quo, ask 5 why - reqires strong executive leadership, creativity, desire and courage.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Good process is essential - scales and can be measured
<br>Bureaucracy is evil. A-players hate it and leave when it starts pressing them.
<br>C and D-players like it because they can hide. Maintain status quo because wont expose underperformance, however create friction that can bog fown entire company
<br>
<br>
<br>Bureaucracy
<br>— rules cant be explained or dont prefer customer
<br>— cant get answer to a reasonable question
<br>— no guaranteed response time built in process
<br>
<br>J: If you cease to insist on high standards and taking risks, you stop loving your work, you will die
<br>
<br>Some tasks cannot be automated: evaluating product images and descriptions
<br>→ crowdsource to vendors and customers - take activities to players who have higher motivation
<br>
<br>forcing  function—a  set  of  guidelines,  restrictions, or  commitments  that  force  a  desirable  outcome  without  having  to  manage  all  the  details  of  making  it  happen (Jesus)
<br>
<br>(BI)
<br>Provide great seller tools, including multiple sell-ing methods and rich data to help merchants op-erate their businesses at Amazon.com. For small sellers, simple tools were needed. For more so-phisticated high-volume sellers, different types of integrated capabilities should be provided. Docu-mentation, operational metrics, testing environ-ments, and professional service partners should be developed to help sellers be successful while keeping the Amazon team small.
<br>
<br>(...) helped us provide great experience to ourcustomers.
<br>
<br>Let the other guy originate the idea, invest the capital, discover a market, and develop operating processes. Then slide in, steal the blueprint, improve upon it, and scale it until the other guy has been left in the dust. The copycat often has advantage in this competition; the original innovator is typically emotionally bound to the original idea and hesitant to change it.
<br>
<br>Innovation culture doesn’t exist without failure. Best projects were built on dust of failure.
<br>
<br>——
<br>
<br>4.  Leadership
<br>
<br>As a leader you are expected to be right. If not, learn, develop insights into the reason of mistakes and share them.
<br>
<br>Powerpoint
<br>— dumbs down conversation and doesn’t push to think all the way through the topic
<br>— narrative 5 page essays extracted to 2: you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences and paragraphs - it forces deeper clarity of thinking
<br>— ppt easy for presenter, hard for audience
<br>— share more information without additional explenation
<br>— when you need to be super specific, it further drives culture of clarity
<br>— communication via written-out narratives develops ideas faster, deeper and more effeciently than oversimplified bullet points
<br>##
<br>
<br>Leaders adapt their perspectives when presented with new evidence and data
<br>
<br>Leaders understand business through metrics
<br>
<br>(Future) Press release
<br>— product announcement before development begins
<br>— this is shere you define goals, requirements, objectives
<br>— great technique anytime when on something critical: launching product, undertaking transformation, launching new market
<br>— a type of forcing function, paints a vision
<br>— define goal in utter clarity - is a tool to reach them
<br>###
<br>
<br>How to write PR
<br>— success has been achieved
<br>— why initiative is important for customer. How dis customer experience improve? What benefits have customers received?
<br>—set clear goals: financial results, operational objectives, market share
<br>— outline principles that led to success. Most imprtant step: describe hardest things accomplished, important decisions and design principles that lead to success
<br>##
<br>
<br>Your business should operate like a nuclear reactor - when problem arises, you should know it immediately - real time alarms abd metrics
<br>
<br>Metrics. Order defect rate - percentage of orders that received 1 or 2 star rating, or refund or dispute - manage performance with one metric
<br>-Late shipments, pre fulfilled cancellations, lol ate shipments
<br>
<br>Zappos acquisition- nonsense to man. Zappos is a customer centric company we see perfect opportunities to learn from each other.
<br>
<br>Hiring - making long term investments
<br>Hire only the best. Set high standards of excellence.
<br>Its difficult and time consuming to get rifld of bad hire- they will drag down those around them.
<br>Bar raiser - I am glad I was hired when I did, because I wouldn't gethirednow. (Metrics: success and retention)
<br>
<br>Report written after each interview. Data immediately processed and applied for next round in 2 hours.
<br>Incredible conmitment to Hire only the best even if you expected to take paycuts
<br>
<br>People who dont excel are freeriding on the rest. As a leadee you are dxpected to improve yours performance to A+.
<br>
<br>———
<br>
<br>6.  INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS
<br>
<br>Echo to everyone to act and think as a leader. Leaders set standards that many see unreasonably high
<br>Acting as a leader means creating a forcing function for highest standards
<br>
<br>J: cookies or cookies&crumpets? Crumpet is a thick and savory cake and it deserves to be recognized - level of detail in discussion
<br>Deadly serious about decision importance
<br>
<br>Startup - excelent work in a breakneck pace
<br>
<br>Negative connotations
<br>
<br>Work life balance - you are expected to act as a leader and owner. Drive business as a car, not a wrecked rental.
<br>Adopt ling vier and truly believe you are part of something that changes the world.
<br>
<br>———
<br>
<br>7 Think Big
<br>
<br>Leaders at Amazon think differently and look for new ways to serve customer
<br>
<br>Amazon has never put short term profits ahead of long term investment and valuation
<br>
<br>Finance - looking at free cashflow instead of margins. You cannot pay bills with percentages, but can with cash.
<br>Subtract expenditures from gross cash flow. Gives you cash available for growing business by adding new categroies, creating new businesses or scaling tech. More accurate model
<br>
<br>J: Take long term view and interests of customers and stakeholders align
<br>
<br>Regret minimization framework
<br>-project yourself to the age of 80 and look back
<br>-would you regret quitting job starting own project? Would you regret if you failed? I know I wouldnt regret participating in thing called internet
<br>-Otherwise questions if you did right thing would haunt you
<br>-shortterm things may confuse you (annual bonus), but if you think long term you can make good decisions you wont regret later
<br>##
<br>
<br>———
<br>
<br>8.  HAVE A BIAS FOR ACTION
<br>
<br>When you’re in doubt - do something and take opportunities of being first can offer
<br>Avoid paralysis from analysis
<br>Move forward on things without being asked to do so
<br>There is no status quo — just a continual effort to push ahead
<br>##
<br>
<br>If you are not inventing for customers and improving their experience every day — even in ways that may hurt on short-term — someone else will.
<br>##
<br>
<br>As radical and controversial it may be today (drone delivery), its perfectly inline with your strategy
<br>Even if it never happens it symbolizes commitment to invent and simplify.
<br>
<br>You should slow down to serve customer better (doing things qickly, not enough resources)
<br>J: if you double number of experiments, you double your inventiveness
<br>
<br>Its true that bias for action encourages decision making based on gut instinct
<br>-Use metrics to improve your ability to be right - have right data in front of you at right time
<br>
<br>Dont let simple things be hard things
<br>-innovating, recruiting,increasing sales are hard things
<br>-administrative should be simple - automate as much ops as possible
<br>
<br>——
<br>
<br>9.  FRUGALITY
<br>
<br>Setrnosť, low-cost, skromnosť
<br>
<br>Forcing function - if you are stuck in a tight box, only way to out is to invent it.
<br>
<br>10.  SELF-CRITICISM
<br>
<br>How can we do better?
<br>
<br>Leader is expected to speak up and make sure the truth is hesrd. 
<br>Like when you hesr rodu stories unlikely to happen.
<br>
<br>Hiding the problem means having it discovered down the road.
<br>
<br>Leadership value - healthy paranoia and looking for improvement
<br>-
<br>Unbarking dog - look under surface to discover competitor threat. Invisible outside by plain sight
<br>-
<br>Most significant long term threat from google. Seemed as allies, but their capabilities, innovative products and services they’d been developing made rsalize they had growing a capacity to migrate into Amazon’s space.
<br>Refuced dependency on google by improving own sesrch and created more places on web for entering amazon.
<br>
<br>——
<br>
<br>11.  BUILDING TRUST
<br>
<br>Handling tasks instead of delegation
<br>-No time, energy and skill to do everything well
<br>-not developing people, hurtimg organisation by not training leaders to future
<br>-you have to build trust
<br>
<br>No worrying about titles, org charts amd roles - devote energy on attacking problems
<br>Most orgs - teams waste time playing chicken game pointing fingers and seizing political advantages
<br>
<br>Lack of trust creates fear - fear of decision, failures, people
<br>1.  Admit your failures
<br>2.  Never point finger - creates fear. Take blame for mistakes which are not directly your fault - people will trust you
<br>3.  Praise tem members in front of peers and superiors
<br>4.  Give people freedom to be creative and explore new ideas. Micromanaging kills trust. Male room for failure and opportunity to learn
<br>5.  Accept confrontation - false agreement is as bad as fighting. If ther’s a difference in opinion, promote open discussion. If there are no disagreements, people may hude their opinions. Explore solutions with intemt to solve problems
<br>6.  Everyone has their own strenghts. Find their value and use it for good of the team
<br>##
<br>
<br>Platform business - a tool for empowering people
<br>
<br>Twi Pizza Team Lead
<br>-6-10 people, autonomous units isolated from companys bureaucracy, encourage leaders, provide opportunity, instil ownership
<br>-cannot work in organisations dominated by fear. Turn atmosphere around. Creativity and innovation will flourish as well
<br>
<br>—-
<br>12.  DIVE DEEP
<br>
<br>As a leader go beyond scope of your job. Stay connected to the details amd audit them frequently
<br>
<br>Jeff worls in fulfilment centres - know what they say and how efficient processds are.
<br>
<br>As a leader make strong predemce at project implementation
<br>Monitor and question your data to the smallest detail
<br>
<br>You need to have willingness to dive deep but need metrics amd systems to collect and analyse them quickly
<br>
<br>Math decision always trump opinions. Many use judgement-based decisions when data-based could be made
<br>
<br>No powerpoint slides - desire to deep dive - clear decision making narratives instead
<br>Slideshow makes only to skim surface of ideas instead of creating argument
<br>--powerpomts shallow, 6 or 2 page narratives are forcing function to deep dive in discussion
<br>--John: when you have to write down ideas in complete sentences and compete paragraphs, it forces deeper clarity of thinking
<br>--Narratives force clarity, prioritisation and accountability to deliver, force audience to understand deeper level
<br>
<br>
<br>--
<br>
<br>13.  DISAGREE AND COMMIT
<br>
<br>As a leaderyou are obligated to respectfully change deductions if you disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable and exhausting. Do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion.when decision is made support wholeheartedly.
<br>
<br>As a leader you are expected to challenge other leaders, challenge CEO and bring robust conversation.
<br>
<br>Colloseum culture - no one leaves unbloodied, if you fight hard you may obtain glory.
<br>
<br>Disagreeing with CEO isbenefitial to you personally and obligation to customer or stakeholder.
<br>
<br>14.  DELIVER RESULTS
<br>
<br>--
<br>————————
<br>Take principles as guideline, not blueprint. Even the most enlighten doctrines will crash in hands of fundamentalists
<br>J: if you're stubborn, you'll give up on experiments soon. If you're not flexible, you'll soon pound your head against the walland you won't see a different solution to your problem
<br>-balance is crucial: don't follow a set of rules as if they constitute a recipe for success.
<br>##
<br>
<br>All rules work in balance.lending too much importance to one, may make framework collapse and ruin desired effect
<br>-being too critical may end up endlessly question yourself and sacrifice bias for action
<br>##
<br>
<br>At my current company, I can't tell you what leadership principles are.
<br>They were likely developed by consultant.
<br>Certainly aren't used to actively make decisions
<br>They must be used every day to make decisions
<br>
<br>Future of service, leading companies will be differentiated by the level of immediacy, empowerˇemt and personalisationtheir self-service capabilities offered to customer
<br>
<br>-anticipate and change around customers needs with unprecef´demted speed
<br>-know which customer interactions are the most valuable and which are the most expensive
<br>-have a culture promoting elimination of manually intensive processes
<br>-provide customers with easy access to all information they need to complete the tasks
<br>
<br>---
<br>Self-Service
<br>
<br>
<br>-lower costs: loreninto developing self service architecture
<br>-improve quality, customer satisfaction and reduce cycle times
<br>-many sound counterintuitive: leaving service cold and impersonal gives greater control to the customer
<br>-60 percent prefer self service over to speaking to a person for CS inquiries
<br>-mobile devices: customers expect greater control over their service experience
<br>##
<br>
<br>Exposing self-service capabilities:
<br>-side-effects: INNOVATVE, efficient, and responsive for long run
<br>-eliminate errors and waste
<br>
<br>Customers are not looking for service. They re looking for getting their things done or resolve issue
<br>Online:
<br>-do itquickly and efficiently, do not want to make phone call, write email, schedule appointment
<br>
<br>True self-service is if customer is able to go from.start to end without any manual interactions, at treir own pace, without having to talk to somebody.
<br>##
<br>-shouldnt be more than 1to 2 logical steps
<br>
<br>Customers wants to accomplish thier goals and define them as they see them
<br>##
<br>If service doesn't enabled that flow is interrupted and company not in touch with customers objectived
<br>-reduce amount of service customer persisits
<br>-eliminate legacy issues impacting implementation
<br>
<br>Enabling end-to-end self service is not easy but customers won't accept anything less
<br>
<br>Self service design
<br>1.  Design from customer's perspective - involve in process, observe as they try to accomplish activities important to them.
<br>-understand objectives and true goals
<br>-assign workflows from customer's perspective regardless how they are owned internally
<br>-expose only what help them accomplish objectives. Remove everything else
<br>
<br>2.  Rethink policies and need for manual intervention
<br>-allow majority of customers make real time decisions and complete their objective.
<br>-identify hands on problems, build right analytics and algorithms
<br>-build an automated system for repeatable decisions with separate decision processfor minority that requires intervention and review
<br>
<br>3.  Require entire process to be automated
<br>-entire process, not just steps
<br>-processes that end in non-automated corners will become evident, correction resulting in significant improvements in cost and speed. It will force root cause error reduction and vastly improve quality
<br>-entire process automation is a forcing function
<br>
<br>4.  Provide state-less workflow for real-time customer feedback
<br>-design self-service flows to support all registration, configuration, provisioning and de-registratiin processes from beginning
<br>
<br>5.  Create metrics for customer's self service experience
<br>-create financial, operational and cost and quality metrics
<br>-break metrics into sub processes and assign to specific internal owners
<br>-use routine meetings to review metrics and encourage each other to improve performance that hurts any part of the process
<br>
<br>6.  Systematically reduce cost
<br>-use methods such as 6sigma, find problem areas creating the highest cost. Then design interactions so simple, obvious, and foolproof that no docs are needed
<br>-implement processes to get feedback of the customer and make sure it's heard throughout organisation
<br>
<br>7.  Unlock data and systems through Service Oriented Architecture SOA and web services
<br>-replacing legacy system is the biggest challenge
<br>-invest in wrapping leegacynsystem using SOA approach
<br>-simplify customer experience by hiding underlaying complexity
<br>
<br>8.  Invest in interface design to make interactions outstanding
<br>-insist on experience excellence in all interactions, including vendors and partners
<br>-this will increase reach of self-service requiring less support from organisation
<br>
<br>9.  Analyse data
<br>-collect data and use them to understand how customer interacts with the system. Show customer these data in a transparent way, including benchmark and set high bar for self service performance
<br>-relentlessly focus on raising the bar for the worst, not the best by measuring and reporting
<br>
<br>10.  Agile
<br>-break long cycle, big bang, waterfall development
<br>-create project teamsbetween business, tech and ops
<br>-challemge the organisation to deliver significant benefit in less than 3 months cycles.
<br>Bias for action allows you to see around the corner and uncover problemswhich haven't been confronted yet, which in turn drives innovation

<br>Extensive real-time data: Providing orders, cus-tomer feedback and other operational information to help sellers do better and make more money.
<br>
<br>Self service takeaways
<br>
<br>Self-service is no longer a “nice-to-have.” Customers not only accept self-service, they expect it. As access to more advanced, web-savvy mobile devices increases, the demand for control over the kind of interaction they choose and the time it takes to reach their objective will only continue to grow.
<br>
<br>Self-service must be “end-to-end.” Yet what too many com-panies accept as self-service will simply not be sufficient to keep pace with the rise and change of their customers’ expectations.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile,  companies  that  have  made  the  change  are already  reaping  the  benefits  of  increased  revenue,  lower costs  to  serve  and  greater  market  share.  And  they  have,  in turn,  become  more  efficient,  performance-oriented  and customer-focused.
<br>

<br>
<br>Free Cash Flow
<br>
<br>Keeping large margins over a long period of time is difficult, and likely results in a smaller market share.
<br>
<br>Cashflow = Cash from ops - Operating expenditures - Taxes
<br>
<br>Cash flow, Cash flow per share - money you can spend - ultimate financial measure
<br>
<br>Why not to focus on earnings, earnings per share, or earnings growth as many others do?
<br>Earnings dont directly tranlate into cashflows, not the present value of future earnings
<br>
<br>Move margins from percentage margins to cash-flow - percentages don't pay the bills, cash does
<br>
<br>Do you want to be a 200M company with 20 percent margin or 10B with 5? I know which I want to be!
<br>
<br>J Company would stagnate without constant innovation and fuel for it is cash-flow.
<br>
<br>Metrics
<br>creation of powerful measurement and mod-eling capabilities. One powerful example of this is the robust and extremely accurate ‘unit economic’ model that was de-veloped. This tool allows merchants, finance analysts, and optimization modelers to understand how different buying 
<br>decisions, process flows, fulfillment paths, and demand sce-narios will affect a product’s contribution profit. This in turn gave Amazon the ability to understand how changes in these variables would impact FCF, and has allowed them to react accordingly.Very few retailers have this type of in-depth financial view of their products, and thus have a difficult job truly making decisions or building processes that optimize the econom-ics. Amazon uses this knowledge to determine the number of warehouses and where they should be placed, to quickly assess and respond to vendor offers,
<br>
<br>What if it turns out...
<br>
<br>Rather than investing in growth, the best course is to invest in improving and optimizing the business model to see if this business model can become FCF positive.
<br>#
<br>
<br>To  improve  FCF,  we  can  focus  on  improving  Cash from  Operations,  or  on  reducing  Operating  Expenditures. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>Platform Business
<br>
<br>Fixed costs.
<br>-While  there is  significant  capital  and  R&D  in  building  the  platform, the  business  then  operates  on  the  “network  effect.
<br>-Once  the  platform  is  established,  costs  are  marginal. In other words, much of your investment is up front.
<br>
<br>Marginal costs.
<br>-customer  marginal  costs  decrease  over  time as  the  scale  of  adoption  and  scale  of  the  platform  increases. 
<br>-accomplished by user management, infrastructure, building the IP in the proprietary platform management layers
<br>-Continuously  reducing  the  IP  of  third-party  components,  and  building  these  capabilities  into  your  platform  capability,  is  a  classic  move  of  driving  toward  commoditization and reducing dependencies on other partners.
