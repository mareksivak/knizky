-always Have track - produce results in shortest possible time - identify goals and nongoals, build for highest impact<br>
<br>
-approximate end goal as soon as possible - maximize effort for biggest impact, hard to make is a way for easy to use<br>
<br>
-Quantify your results (if your goal is for speed, always measure every change)<br>
<br>
-Most people waste time optimising noc critical parts<br>

7 Elements for success<br>
<br>
Inspiration: Thinking big ideas and imagining what might be possible<br>
<br>
Collaboration - combine complementary skills<br>
<br>
Craft - apply skill to achieve high quality result, always strive to do better<br>
<br>
Diligence - never resort in shortcuts<br>
<br>
Decisiveness - never refuse to delay or procrastinate, make hard choices<br>
<br>
Taste - develop refined judgement, produce pleasing and integrated whole<br>
<br>
Empathy: Trying to see the world from other people’s perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs<br>
<br>
--<br>
You don't need to write Collaborate! On the wall - feel them on instinctibe level. Imposing fixed methodology would snuff out innovation you're seeking<br>
<br>
mixing inspiration and decisiveness to create initial prototypes, or by combining collaboration, craft, and taste to give detailed feedback to a teammate, or when we blended diligence and empathy in our constant effort to make software people could use without pulling their hair out.<br>
<br>
Blackberry was strong with their hardware keyboard.<br>
iPhone had virtual keyboards. No physical response. It can be successful only with effective autocorrect.<br>
<br>
I got feedback on autocorrect only from a few people before launch. All details were strictly confidential<br>
<br>
Steve was sitting in diplomacy. Just returned from health-relted leave and make all important product decisions.<br>
I was in circle showing him demos. There were even more exclusive circles and he was sitting in the middle of them<br>
<br>
He used these demo reviews as his chief means of deciding how Apple software should look and feel and function.<br>
<br>
He was always easy to understand.<br>
Either approved the demo or requested to see something fˇdifferent next time<br>
<br>
His moods were unpredictable but passion for product always predictable<br>
-<br>
He wanted Apple products to be great<br>
He insisted on being involved in the process as *it went along*, guide the development through his reviews<br>
He wanted to see my latest progress and then push the work toward his ideal with his feedback and suggestions.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he said very specifically what he wanted<br>
“Add more space between these two elements,” or “Replace the green in this graphic with blue,” or “None of this is working. Show me more options next time.”<br>
<br>
Always ensure the products were as *intuitive and straightforward as possible,*<br>
<br>
demos, asking for changes, reviews, approvals - he could make them turn out as he wanted<br>
<br>
It was common knowledge that Steve saw demos in Diplomacy and that people would quietly come and go from the room on demo day.<br>
<br>
Like a Greek Oracle.<br>
<br>
I’d witnessed Henri’s ability to remain calm in stressful situations<br>
He might say to me “I just heard Steve reported a bad bug.” The actual message he’d received had been more like: “THE F***ING CAPS LOCK BUTTON DOESN’T WORK IN TODAY’S BUILD! DON’T YOU PEOPLE TEST THIS F***ING KEYBOARD?!”<br>
-he knew people can fix it but pressure won't make it faster<br>
<br>
Steve valued Scott’s ability to imagine how new technologies might be integrated into our software products.<br>
Scott excelled in making these *connections*<br>
If a programmer told Scott about an in-the-works software change to the touchscreen system that would make it possible to reliably differentiate between quick swiping gestures and slower panning gestures, *Scott could visualize a user feature like swiping on an item in a list*, say an email message, to delete it.<br>
<br>
Steve's mission<br>
to take the latest software and hardware advances, mix them with elements of design and culture, and produce features and products that people found useful and meaningful in their everyday lives.<br>
<br>
Scott had his position because he could make technology-to-people links with such ease, sometimes with lack of pauses<br>
<br>
Software keyboard - make each key smaller than fingertip and develop necessary improvements by autocorrect<br>
<br>
*Difficult development path is the best way to make products easy to use.*<br>

Try to sneak a slipshot demo past him? You will be caught in a his sharp jaws<br>
<br>
Greg want the most popular. To those who shared his high standards and his abheremce for lazy justifications, he was unceasingly loyal and supportive<br>
<br>
Bas possessed genius level skills in illustration, animation and demo creation - contributed to intuitive feel of iOS<br>
-scrolling in list - speeds up, bonces on end, glides when you stop<br>
-this clearly matched our sense howthis I teraction should behave<br>
<br>
My job was open ended. was expected to find, create, and contribute to projects that made our software better.<br>
<br>
One day I stopped by to visit bus. As usual he was up to something cool<br>
<br>
Quick prototype - good sense of how the real thing would work.<br>
He’d made this demo to test some variations.<br>
<br>
iPad keyboard prototype<br>
As he pressed buttons and sliders he made letters bigger, color of keys light or dark, altered the dimensions of space or delete<br>
<br>
-each changeaccompanied with carefully crafted *animation  that highlighted what was changing*<br>
<br>
As Bas took me through all his variations, he gave me a quick explanation that made every option seem *reasonable and practical.*<br>
<br>
iPhone constraint - remove as many keynas possible from main layout<br>
We made as separate 123 key to access punctuation and numbers<br>
We worried there would be complaints about this arrangement - people adopted and accepted without much fuss<br>
<br>
his enthusiasm was infectious. When he finished up his demo and turned around to me, I had a smile on my face.<br>
<br>
This was in contrast to Bas’s approach,<br>
<br>
If I could mimic geometry of Mac keyboard, maybe I would make typing on iPad co.fortable to Mac users<br>
<br>
On the drive over to Target, I conjured up an image of the ruler I would get. It would be beautiful, sturdy, made of metal, suitable for a professional draftsman, the kind of precision measuring instrument Apple might make. Target didn’t have anything like the Platonic ideal ruler of my imagination. -1ft, plastic, cheap - a few decades back, a version of me would be pleased enough<br>
<br>
Bas’s *ability* to *tell the story* of the software through the zoom animation he’d designed.<br>
<br>
Visceral design<br>
-touch that made apple products easy to use<br>
Zoom button - adding more keys to keyboard<br>
-one keyboard was becoming another, animation didn't look like clicking from one slide to another<br>
-scaling - keys changes size to match arriving view<br>
-*timing: starting slowly, sped up as it went - make you feel you have definitely landed when animation finished*<br>
<br>
Steve demo<br>
-tapped the key. No reaction no hint of what he was thinking.<br>
Like an high-stakes poker player checking his cards<br>
Screen changed and he started study all over again<br>
Taking 30s to absorb wvery detail<br>
<br>
Switching between two keyboard layouts<br>
-*we only need one of these right?* Which one do you think we should use?<br>
He didn't shift in chair bringing anyone in - it was my demo and he wanted my answer<br>
Me: I started like bigger keys. I think I could learn type and anyone else would too<br>
Steve never moved eyes to anyone else. *He was completely present*<br>
Ok, we'll go with bigger keys<br>
<br>
/They offered encouraging comments - good job, nice demo/<br>
/I reverted to my natural state as an introvert, and having just received far more than my recommended daily dose of concentrated eye contact, I looked at the floor./<br>
<br>
Know yourself<br>
-amswers you are seeking may lie within you<br>
-asking on opinion is a test if you can give satisfactory answer<br>
-making contributions to the discussions is away to earn future invitations<br>
<br>
Demos at Apple are primary means to turn ideas into software<br>
*How you make software great*<br>
<br>
Steve- making great software was a core corporate focus<br>
<br>
He *demanded action*, and so the software team produced demos in a steady stream, and whenever there was interesting new work, Steve found the time to attend a demo review so he could see it. *His involvement kept the progress and momentum going.*<br>
<br>
RDF - reality distortion field - many people said - Steve had ability to make you believe everything he said<br>
<br>
Programmer, designer, editors - everything we needed<br>
Some roles could be fluid - designer wrote bits of code without help of programmer<br>
<br>
*Decisiveness was crucial. Scott was executive editor - decider*<br>
Every demo had a decided - a person with authority to approve and decide next steps<br>
Before reviews - meeting between contributors / each of us could decide about portion of work, time and effort - pursue new idea or make refinement<br>
<br>
*Day to day work* - a pyramid of demos, reviews and decisions building up to the Steve's final judgement<br>
<br>
When I was invited to Steve's demo - my word counted as much as my work<br>
<br>
Hierarchically limited access to CEO - *less to do with org rank and more with your ability to make products better*<br>
<br>
Steve as gatekeeper couldn't bring C-level demos to Steve hoping to sell them.<br>
This would be a good way to trigger Steves temper and good way forScott to lose his role<br>
<br>
In our demo steve saw what he liked, but found demo complicated<br>
Even the discussion - arriving to conclusion was minimal<br>
<br>
Scott - just used enough words to tell what's on the agenda, where to focus attention and who I was<br>
Then Steve looked into it and asked me if the work could be simpler<br>
<br>
*Push for simplicity-. Purpose -.* <br>
Steve could put himself in the shoes of customers, people who cared nothing for the ins and outs of the software industry. He never wanted Apple software to *overload people,* especially when they might *already be stretched by the bustle of their everyday lives*.<br>
<br>
Imagine mum taking care of sick son, running late to work and responding emails on the way<br>
Steve believed she would do better with product that wasn’t *loaded down with every thingamabob* the product designers could *dream up.*<br>
*Cutting off non-essential features makes products easy to use and learn*<br>
He wanted to products speak for themselves<br>
He knew that most of the time there is no one around you to tell you how to start<br>
<br>
One keyboard layout<br>
-remive zoom button<br>
-take away possible confusion about which keyboard to show in different situations. - should you default simple keyboards for notes and compact one for mail?<br>
<br>
Steve figured that the *best way to answer difficult questions* like these was to *avoid the need to ask them.*<br>
<br>
People surrounding home were good at making decisions. When Steve asked me - it was a test of my decosiveness<br>
<br>
Arguing again at Steve would be speaking in favor of complexity<br>
<br>
Demos<br>
We used them to highlight the potential, explore the concepts, show the progress, prompt the discussion, and drive the decisions for making our products. <br>
<br>
The elegance and simplicity of their Mac software was my main inspiration for wanting to become a programmer.<br>
<br>
Easel - Chief among our missteps was failing to conceive of our software as a single product instead of as a set of separate projects. We never figured out how to integrate the pieces.<br>
-connectuons, updates, were unstable and buggy<br>
<br>
Microsoft began to fear that computer users would change their technology habits, shifting money and influence to Netscape, the company that made the most popular web browser.<br>
Netscape published all source code hoping hoping free code may become standard for internet apps and bringing support and consulting deals<br>
<br>
Scott was always like this. You had to be on your guard, or his fusillade of questions might knock you off your feet.<br>
-how did you make animations smooth, how did you design algorithm, did you use cocoa framework?<br>
<br>
We were team of two to build a browser for Apple. Microsoft had large teams. Nesˇtscape used to have too. How could we compete?<br>
<br>
We didn't need to start from scratch. There was Mozilla - Netscape open source. There was couple of other open source and commercial options as well<br>
<br>
Richard Williamson began by telling me that he knew how to get results fast.<br>
<br>
Richard said he’d downloaded KDE and set himself a simple goal: Get the code running on the Mac as quickly as possible so he could evaluate the potential of the Konqueror web browser.<br>
<br>
We worked on that 6 weeks, he built demo in 2 days - two shortcuts - run KDE on Mac and used X Windows instead of Apple Core Graphics - native system. He was running entire KDE, not just Konqueror.<br>
<br>
Richard didn't worry that KDE didn't integrate perfectly with menu bar, or provide perfect don't rendering - this would be addressed down the road<br>
<br>
10x programmer - super productive, can get value of a few mortars<br>
<br>
“When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.”<br>
<br>
Fast progress - no dependencies, no massive communication needed when teams are small<br>
<br>
-make judgements about ways to not enter (Mozilla was no-go)<br>
-have self-confidence (you may stand up against your managers)<br>
-*produce result in shortest possible schedule* (he identified 3 features, loading pages, links, clicking back)<br>
-*defime nongoals* - Can be put aside (font rendering, integration with apple native graphics, minimize code used from KDE)<br>
<br>
I just wanted to get Mozzila work. I had no plan, no goals, no nongoals, no shortcuts, no tight schedule<br>
This *difference in thinking leads to difference in outcome*<br>
<br>
Why Eazel crashed - *We never had track* we are on way to deliver excellent product<br>
*We never considered quick get-it-done* ways<br>
We worked in Apple in the same way at Eazel - we didn't have a way to bootstrap project and set it on course<br>
Richardshowed Konqueror can work on Mac. Despite cutoffs, cumulative effect created a version of real browser<br>
Replicated reality onscreen creates an illusion of sth real - ex movies<br>
<br>
Same way - demos should be specifically choreographed, so it’s clear what must be included and what can be left out.<br>
Things that aren't main focus, but are required to make a proper setting, must be kept there at correct level of detail so the contribute to the vision<br>
<br>
Focus on what's important (loading, links, navigation)<br>
Ignore irrelevant details (icon, fonts)<br>
-maximize impact, minimize distractions<br>
*-i am thinking of intended audience, and choose what features to include*<br>
<br>
I draw a circle and put *key details* inside - must be highly detailed<br>
Outside - less important details - eventually have to be addressed, but not immediately - pay them as little attention as possible<br>
<br>
Some elements are on the line - make scene believable<br>
<br>
Illusion of real product is important during Dev process to maintain the vision<br>
<br>
-Look for ways to make quick progress. <br>
-*Watch for project stalls that might indicate a lack of potential.* <br>
-Cut corners to skip unnecessary effort. <br>
-*Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be.* <br>
-Start approximating your end goal as soon as possible. <br>
-*Maximize the impact of your most difficult effort.*<br>
<br>
even after I fix all the compiler errors and get a program to build successfully, the program rarely does the desired job exactly right the first time. -fail to produce the desired result,<br>
<br>
very glad we had made this decision and that we had maintained the discipline to add these annotations whenever we had doubts about a piece of code while we were editing it.<br>
<br>
Edison<br>
“None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes.<br>
For Edison, it was more *important to build on promising ideas* and keep working and working until an invention was made real.<br>
<br>
Inspiration (getting flash insight) : hard work = 1:100 time<br>
<br>
Hard work is essential<br>
<br>
I agree with Edison. *Ideas are nothing without the hard work to make them real.*<br>
<br>
Inspiration does not pay off without diligence.<br>
<br>
The focus would be on one thing: speed. Steve wanted our browser to be fast, *really fast* at loading web pages<br>
-much faster than IE, the product we aimed to replace<br>
<br>
$*build around one core thing*<br>
Start with purpose<br>
Ms<br>
<br>
Apple-style collaboration, a small group focused on a shared objective, and ours was developing a fast web browser.<br>
<br>
No one wanted them asking whether we had given them an improved web surfing experience. <br>
Steve reasoned that a speedy new Apple browser would be the best way to make people forget about Internet Explorer and to feel good about our replacement right away.<br>
<br>
Speed was part of Steves vision of internet connectivity - speed was long term key to better browsing<br>
Hi-performance browser - definition of greatness<br>
<br>
We needed to figure out how to make browser faster<br>
<br>
I wrote Plage Load Test - stopwatch to measure loading time<br>
No code changes without running the PLT.<br>
<br>
Code reviews<br>
Whenever I finished editing some code, I would write a detailed summary of what my edits did, what feature it implemented or what bug it fixed, how changes accomplished the goals.<br>
Improvements, requests - then ok to commit<br>
<br>
Feature implementation, bug fixes - qualitative measures<br>
PTL - *quantitative* measure to evaluate changes - *either browser stayed where it was or gotfaster*.<br>
<br>
From that moment the software was getting only faster and we could prove it<br>
<br>
Sometimes unforeseen speedups came from handling FIXMEs<br>
*Higher-quality code often performs faster.*<br>
<br>
Programmers waste time *worrying about speed of non-critical parts of programs* - impact on maintenance<br>
Forget 97%  small inefficiencies -premature optimisation is root of the evil<br>
<br>
Kitchen<br>
97percent of time optimisation wrong<br>
-move things from fridge to table with minimum armloads<br>
-the more i try to load, thehigher chance chance something drops<br>
-am I trying to minimize trips between fridge and desk? I don't know. Don't have enough context.<br>
-Instruction Use as little armloads as possible increased chance of bugs, code if hard to maintain and speed is not faster. More difficult to achieve, no or small results<br>
<br>
-use basket? Bring table closer?<br>
<br>
*97%of the time we focus on wrong things*<br>
Low impact<br>
<br>
PLT showed us where we were introducing slowness <br>
It told us WHEN to pay attention to small imefficiencies<br>
<br>
Common project management<br>
-get done first, make correct<br>
-optimize, improve later - often takes longer to complete, Very often no resources for that, -delivery schedules cannot be changed. Drop performance<br>
<br>
We had performance directive from Steve<br>
<br>
He had us carefully choose optimisation opportunities based on clear and provable evidence<br>
<br>
PLT - we distributed optimosationthroughout the project<br>
We optimised when we knew what we're doing<br>
<br>
When it wasn't possible to avoid slowdown, we instituted a trading scheme - improved part of code which was stable or we knew well.<br>
Keeping discipline, code getting faster<br>
<br>
Internally called Alexamder ( as conqueror) - not customer facing<br>
Steve Jobs had some name ideas, and when I first heard them, I cringed. - Thunder or Freedom<br>
I couldn't imagine people say - I work on Freedom<br>
<br>
Safari. It conveyed the same world-traveler feel<br>
<br>
Keynotes success<br>
<br>
Started months before<br>
Slowly, day by day, he would build the show by stepping through it as he wanted to present it at the keynote. This was one of Steve’s great secrets of success as a presenter. He practiced.<br>
<br>
once I saw his technique, it seemed so right to me that I’ve used it myself for my own presentation Ever since<br>
-<br>
When Steve spoke to a slide, he went *fully into his keynote persona*. His tone of voice, his stance, his gestures, everything was exactly as if he were presenting to a packed house.<br>
-<br>
As needed, he stopped, stepped out of character, reduced the volume of his voice, and asked on some turn of phrase or whether they believed ideas flowed together smoothly.<br>
-<br>
Feedback received, Steve would pause quite deliberately for a second or two, go back into character, and resume his keynote persona.<br>
If a phrase still didn’t run right, he would pause, back up, and try again. Sometimes he did this three or four times, each time with an absolutely clear separation between attempts, like takes on a movie set.<br>
<br>
Even if everything was polished - he was committed to making every slide and every phrase better if he could.<br>
<br>
Stores - better custoˇer service and buying g experiemce<br>
<br>
People doubted about Macs - selling caviar in the world eating cheese and crackers - former CFo<br>
<br>
“That’s the update on Apple retail stores. We could not be happier, and I hope that we’ve won over some of the critics who, when we opened our first stores, said we would most certainly fail.”<br>
<br>
Steve also announced that Safari not only loaded web pages faster than Internet Explorer … it loaded web pages three times faster. After Steve showed the Safari icon, he clicked to the next slide.<br>
<br>
*Speed* wasn't only marketing - it was *purpose*<br>
This clear connection of words to actions in a product development cycle was new to me. We didn't have it at Eazel<br>
<br>
Such connection is rare to find<br>
Baseball - well it was a good game tonight, things went well with us, taking one game at the time<br>
Apple-like link, new coach speech - gentlemen, we are *going to do things differently* than they have been done before.<br>
We're going to relentlessly *catch perfection - we will not catch it but in the process we will catch excellence.*<br>
*I am not interested in being just good*<br>
What is one thing to perfect? One play. - the most important thing we have. Then repeat it<br>
-the shared his tactics: Power Sweep, practice after practice<br>
Lombardi<br>
<br>
In any complex effort, communicating a well-articulated *vision* for what you’re trying to do is the *starting point* for figuring out how to do it.<br>
<br>
Maybe your source of anxiety is that will not work on start<br>
<br>
Apple - fast browser -- never make it slower - measure speed and monitor progress<br>
<br>
Whatever you do - to attain excellence : close gap between accidental and intentional, achieved something or everything but a specific and well chosen thing<br>
*Turn words into vision and use that vision to spur actions and create results*<br>
<br>
Vince Lombardi - Steve Jobs of football.<br>
*Same pursuit of quality and perfection*<br>
<br>
He understood I like projects more than politics - he said he might have an interesting project idea for me<br>
Scott’s overall vote of confidence in me meant more than any specific thing he said<br>
<br>
Steve used his Next computer for writing emails because he thought experience offered was superior<br>
<br>
Included Steve Jobs in pitch<br>
He was right - there were not many engineers in position to make webkit editing a reality<br>
<br>
Darin and Trey asked questions, and after about a half hour, they had located the root of my insertion point problem: I was spending too much time thinking about data and not enough thinking about the visuals.<br>
Busy in HTML, *neglected* to write code to *produce results* I wanted<br>
<br>
I wanted to move insertion point on taps or on keys - they said I didn't have a single piece of code for making this correctly from user's point of view<br>
<br>
I did point detection and coordination on HTML level<br>
They said I need authoritative piece of software that says move instˇertion point one position to the right - that handles complications of HTML and result what user will see<br>
<br>
Insertion point sometimes disappeared - that should never happen<br>
My code needed explicit steps that ensured the insertion point always stayed visible—<br>
<br>
After our meeting, I did exactly as they’d advised.<br>
<br>
I was stuck and they were skillful. My state of mind also played a role<br>
If I wasn't desperately stuck I would be more defensive and less open for advice, I would be more subtle to talk about problems I had<br>
<br>
Once it was clear to Darin and Trey that their advice was leading to obvious improvements in my code, they appeared to like it.<br>
We could talk in more details and collaboration gave them tehnical grounding for further suggestions<br>
*Succeeded in getting them invested*<br>
It wasn't my project any more - it was ours<br>
<br>
People matter more than work<br>
-we have tendency tendency to answer questions with technological answers. But those are our relationships which enable us to see answers<br>
<br>
Steve Jobs : if what you do turns out to be pretty good, you shouldn't dwell on it for too long and do something else wonderful - figure out what's next<br>
<br>
Becoming managers<br>
-from writing software to worrying about my team<br>
-day full of meeting<br>
-navigate cross-functional relationships with other team involving politics<br>
-i realised how much I relied on writing code to feel productive and hapoy<br>
-my programming skills didn't matter and I didn't have *intuitive sense* of what I need to succeed as manager<br>
<br>
I said that managing the sync team wasn’t for me,<br>
Scott wanted to understand and help me, but he wasn’t convinced I knew what I wanted,<br>
He asked me to wait before I made any decisions, - meeting was over<br>
<br>
Human Interface (HI) team. They were the designers who would imbue Purple software with a spirit, from concepts and principles to animations and icons.<br>
<br>
PURPLE<br>
<br>
iPod software platform - handheld devices - they questioned whether it could be expanded into a sophisticated system that<br>
AppKit and WebKit options were deemed impractical<br>
<br>
potential to rival and cannibalize the sales of the hottest Apple product of the day, the iPod, - internal competition about the next big thing<br>
<br>
<br>
Essence of demos - expecting progress<br>
Demos - open forums where everyone could speak up. Suggestions for changes, impressions,. What to do differently<br>
Echnachanhing ideas about function and interaction<br>
Sometimes demo happended poorly- stream of constructive criticism<br>
<br>
Managers:<br>
-is this demo closing prototype to product gap?<br>
-is tech on track?<br>
-*are we seeing enough positive change over the last time?*<br>
<br>
Keyboard - inaccurate, progress slow<br>
Henri made announcement - set projects aside, temporarily halt all work on safari, mail,...pushing a big pause button<br>
He wanted everyone start making keyboards right away<br>
<br>
Blackberry enjoying success with well design keyboards<br>
Purple concept - big touch screen, minimum of hardware buttons<br>
<br>
“Your keyboards are like everybody else’s, and they don’t work. Everyone is making their keys too small, and they’re too hard to tap,” he told me. “The keys need to be bigger.”<br>
<br>
All keyboard prototypes were like moon rockets<br>
A *new kind of user interaction was needed to get involved* - software assistance, predictions<br>
<br>
Packed keys. Your finger covered up the thing you were trying to tap - you didn't see what you are doing<br>
This was a problem Richard wanted to solve.<br>
<br>
Richard wanted to explore this idea<br>
<br>
Picking the correct gesture on a created an additional mental burden that made it hard to think. We often got lost in the middle of typing a word.<br>
Any arrangement different from qwerty was hard to use<br>
-would we get used? These keyboards were not instant success for sure<br>
<br>
My principles<br>
-bigger keys are easier to tap<br>
-qwerty - easier to find right letters<br>
-only tap gesture to use<br>
I thought there was still more unrealized potential to reduce the mental burden.<br>
I wanted a key lard that demanded less attention from people - letting them think what to write and less think how to use interface<br>
<br>
I decided to have a nonconforming demo that functioned properly, rather than the opposite,<br>
<br>
None of the demo keyboards offered quick and accurate typing.<br>
Some involved blue-sky interaction models,<br>
good graphics, clever idea, interesting concept—He found something positive on each<br>
<br>
Concrete and specific Demos matter<br>
We rarely had brainstorming sessions. <br>
I recall only a few times in my entire Apple career when I stood around to rough out big plans at a whiteboard.<br>
-<br>
Whiteboard discussions feel like work, but often they’re not, since it’s too difficult to talk productively about ideas in the abstract. Think of a cute puppy - picture of puppy in my mind is cuter than yours notion<br>
-<br>
If brainstorming takes longer than an hour, or there is too many people - can turn into sneaky procrastination<br>
<br>
Innovation<br>
Although we had little collective experience with touchscreen software keyboards before Henri told us to start working on them, that lack of grounding didn’t matter to us. <br>
We picked a point over the technological horizon and, together, we set out toward it, unsure if we were headed in exactly the right direction.<br>
<br>
-we tried each other's demos, said what we liked and didn't like. Offered suggestions which led to more demos<br>
-This virtuous collaborative cycle in the Purple hallway helped me to produce a promising keyboard demo, one the company was willing to back.<br>
<br>
Fear that keyboard kills the product<br>
<br>
Invention<br>
The keyboard was different. None of us knew how a touchscreen keyboard was supposed to work. <br>
*I had to constantly ask myself whether what seemed like a good solution to me was actually a good solution.* <br>
I didn’t know. Typing on a small sheet of glass was new.<br>
<br>
Phil Schiller - *marketing*<br>
the man who, after Steve, was most responsible for communicating to prospective *customers exactly why we thought our products were great* and why they should go out and buy one.<br>
<br>
Phil wasn’t satisfied, and he said so.<br>
-<br>
he had none of the emotional connection I had to my keyboard. *While I had been working hard on it, for Phil it was brand new*, and he was indifferent to it. He expected the software to win him over, and apparently, it didn’t.<br>
-<br>
His reaction was just like a prospective customer evaluating the product<br>
-<br>
Demo took 2mins<br>
<br>
Tech people want to try new things<br>
Devs get incentives to create features<br>
None wants products be confusing, becoming overcomplicated, dumb<br>
Apples identity was not to have this problem<br>
<br>
Great Products<br>
designing an excellent user experience was as much about preventing negative experiences as facilitating positive ones.<br>
-<br>
Great products make people happy almost all the time and<br>
<br>
/From today's perspective it would be limitation/<br>
/we were making it up as we went along./<br>
<br>
On the Purple hallway, *we were trying to make excellent products for people,*<br>
<br>
<br>
There was something wrong about these 4 principles as a summed total<br>
<br>
Greg never sugarcoated his comments. If he thought a feature was no good, he told you. But when Greg gave feedback, I always listened for a hint of exasperation, as if what he was saying were obvious. If he had that tetchy tinge in his voice, it meant he was confident.<br>
<br>
Multiple letters per key - He thought that was the design decision holding back progress. That was the root problem.<br>
<br>
Customer centricity<br>
<br>
He proposed to change back to one letter per each key.<br>
*He had no I sight to think how it was accomplished in code.*<br>
 -tech cost not his business<br>
<br>
Keyboard design<br>
Means for People to *communicate their input to the device and structuresoftware so it could understand it*<br>
<br>
Keys appeared smaller but autocorrection saw each pressed key as a part of group with its neighbours<br>
Since you could target individual letter, you could type anything you wanted<br>
Still slow writing - need to tap on bubble. What if pressing keyboard was a signal for keyboard to make a choice between typing word and suggestion?<br>
<br>
Junky pressed produced perfect typing - *opposite of garbage in, garbage out, as software was supposed to work*<br>
<br>
As we developed software products at Apple, programming and design details were foremost in our minds. <br>
We moved past each prototype quickly and started making the next one.<br>
<br>
Empathy<br>
<br>
empathy as trying to see the world from other people’s perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs.<br>
<br>
showed several breakdowns in empathy, - software attempting to provide assistance<br>
<br>
At Apple, we sought to be as empathetic as possible<br>
<br>
couldn’t open myself to an infinite regress of ideas at every step of accomplishing a task. It’s important to keep making progress and to keep sight of priorities.<br>
As a maker I cam less to the theoretical and more to the applied<br>
<br>
*Persist too long in making choices without justifying them*, - aimless effort<br>
*Evaluate, find self-confidence*<br>
Building trust in your refined responses takes practice<br>
<br>
Study great work from the past - gives means of comparison and contrast - - tap into collective creativity of past generations <br>
Past - source of timeless and enduring<br>
<br>
When I study the past, I make point deciding what I like<br>
Sometimes this *like-catalog finds outlet and expression in my present day work.*<br>
<br>
Qwerty is part of cultural hertage. People are familiar with it - taps into decades of your muscle memory / creates nearly automatic response<br>
-as product guy, I cannot offer anything else to make better use of knowledge<br>
-from his view - any other arrangement would be hard to use<br>
<br>
Give decisive statement - explains why it works, doesnt<br>
-“/I like this animation since it helps to *direct the user’s attention* appropriately,”/<br>
-“/I don’t like this color scheme because it *fails to provide adequate contrast* between these dissimilar elements,”/<br>
<br>
The small-scale justifications must contribute to a scheme larger than themselves.<br>
<br>
BEATY - make software appeal visually attractive<br>
.<br>
Steve Jobs once said, “*Design is how it works.”*<br>
Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it [a product] looks like—that the designers are handed this box and told, “*Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like.* Design is how it works.<br>
-<br>
€Perfect function - perfect appearance<br>
<br>
Shallow beauty doesn't serve people<br>
Product design should *strive for a DEPTH, for a BEAUTY rooted in what a product does, not merely in how it looks and feels.*<br>
appearance of a product should *tell you what it is and how to use it.* Objects should explain themselves.<br>
-same applies for pixels on screen<br>
<br>
Even so, popularity doesn’t equal excellence.<br>
<br>
Qwerty<br>
Typing without thinking about it. The keyboard can *melt away*, it can recede, and when it does, it *leaves a space for what people really care about*.<br>
- Perfect product becomes invisible - focus on experience<br>
- Julio<br>
<br>
mixture of *TASTE and EMPATHY* is the secret formula for making products that are intuitive, easy to use, and easy to live with.<br>
<br>
TASTE - *judgements*<br>
To Narrow down unbounded possibilities<br>
<br>
I wouldn't make progress if I couldn't reject infinite amount of ideas<br>
<br>
Judgement - there are more efficient layouts than qwerty. Should we use others?<br>
Empathy - qwerty is cultural heritage and people are used to that. give familiarity with how keyboards look and work<br>
<br>
*Path to Excellence - close gap between accidental and intentional*<br>
*Not something or everything g, but specific and we'll chosen thing*<br>
Steve Jobs<br>
Lombardi<br>
<br>
<br>
In development precess, *progress is rarely constant*<br>
Positive moments are balanced with less positive experiences<br>
<br>
Convergence<br>
-a final phase after features had been locked down and teams fix bugs and polish details.<br>
We had clear picture how it will work<br>
<br>
Autocorrect bugs<br>
I wondered whether keyboard autocorrection would ever be reliable enough to ship in a product and whether the sum of all the small fixes I might make would ever equal something greater.<br>
Bizarre results would make people distrust the software - doubt their ability to type<br>
<br>
We needed to make autocorrect better over time<br>
-teached it recognize hate speech, slang, places, lamdmarks<br>
<br>
You don't need to be math expert to solve complex math problems<br>
-<br>
Richard showedthat it was possible to make technical headway by *skipping past the problems he couldn’t solve in favor of those he could*. So, that’s what I did.<br>
<br>
Letter popups<br>
It was exactly the kind of feedback that can connect people and software.<br>
<br>
I was focused on my difficult work of improving autocorrect - I didn't know about hardware difficulties or negotiations with carriers<br>
MobileSafari - hard to tap on links - we wrote a code that look for nearby links on tap - we needed scores of these allowances to make system intuitive and easy to use<br>
<br>
I handled this on reasonable working hours<br>
<br>
Once I lost my temper<br>
<br>
Designers enhancement request<br>
Engineers bug report<br>
<br>
Zero bugs - no code is fault free<br>
Bug fixing doesn't make software great<br>
<br>
DESIGN<br>
Withought a person who *thoroughly understands design principles*, company runs out of reasons for design decisions.<br>
Doubt creeps in.<br>
instincts fail<br>
When it turns to engineering to solve problems. <br>
*Reduce decisions to simple logic problems*<br>
Remove subjectivity and look at the data.<br>
Is data in your favor? Ship it<br>
Not? Back to drawing board<br>
<br>
At google they couldn't decide between 2 shades of blue, so they tested 40 blues to see which one performs best<br>
Dynamic range between the best and the worst is not much.<br>
Opportunity cost of such trials - less time to dream up a design that people may like 2x, 3x or 10x.<br>
<br>
AB tests find better option but can't produce a pleasing product<br>
-<br>
At Apple, we never staged any A/B tests for any of the software on the iPhone. When it came to choosing a color, we picked one. We used our good taste—and our knowledge of how to make software accessible to people with visual difficulties related to color perception—and we moved on.<br>
-<br>
We always *made quick choices about small details*, but we were always willing to reconsider previous decisions. *We took more time with bigger questions,* but never too much. We were always mindful of making steady progress.<br>
-<br>
*Moving towards the goal*<br>
-lessons from konqueror demo and safari develeopment<br>
We were constantly converging toward the next demo.<br>
The next demo was never far away, and often it was quite close.<br>
Soˇetimes it took me minutes to prepare<br>
We were continuously producing fresh rounds of software like this, to test our latest ideas and assumptions.
