<br>Empathy
<br>-umderstanding, others points of view
<br>-not sympathy or being nice
<br>-rarely used together with business
<br>
<br>-understand customer needs and improve products with meaningful insights from newfound perspectives
<br>-collaborate better, understand skills and how to get most out of interactions
<br>
<br>CDs at brick and mortar stores, Napster and Lime more empathetic distribution system
<br>-when there's disruption, key players try to protect their market (personal computing, digital cameras, ride sharing, airbnb)
<br>
<br>But had they applied empathy more meaningfully in their decision-making, they could have recognized new and innovative ways to lead their businesses into the next era.
<br>
<br>Boring company, Elon Musk
<br>While all intellectuals envisioned a world of flying cars, he focus on building technologically advanced tunnelling businessdesigned to solve congested road problems by expanding them under ground
<br>These companies and their leaders understand how to use empathy to look at *problems differently* and create solutions that not only disrupt conventions but use empathy as a powerful tool.

<br>Our clients come to us because we can help them figure out who they truly are, what they are actually trying to accomplish,
<br>And take their goals to higher level
<br>
<br>Empathy - better understand peop´e, give insight how to drive better, more effective actions

<br>We asked more questions and weren’t surprised to learn that none of the people we interviewed had given much thought to the patient’s comfort. It wasn’t that they didn’t care about the patient, but it wasn’t their job to consider the patient. Their primary concerns were the machinery, the procedure, and the test results.

<br>We took our findings to GE and proposed that they grow their business by doing more than simply selling their product to hospitals and leaving it at that. They needed to take into consideration every aspect — from the terminology used by the staff to the gowns, the temperature, the lighting, and perhaps even the scent of the room.
<br>we were telling them that the way to improve their imaging business was not just by selling machines but by providing services that put their machines into the best, most empathically designed environments possible.

<br>... held on Thanksgiving weekend in Chicago. (An unempathic time and place for many conference attendees, but so be it.) 
<br>
<br>—-
<br>
<br>Empathy
<br>Establishing perspective. Dropping biases
<br>
<br>Better product - i may think of building functionality, customers want better price
<br>Experiment with various perspectives. There is no wrong
<br>
<br>We were building our plane while we were flying it
<br>
<br>We decided to male ourselves our best client.

<br>
<br>I began looking for moments when my thoughts and actions were coming from an empathic place and realizing how often, to my disappointment, they were not.
<br>
<br>I spend a lot of my day cooking up ideas for clients that help solve their problems.
<br>If you throw me into a room with zero preparation and give me some markers and a whiteboard, I’m probably going to sit there staring at it for an hour or two before anything happens.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Creatives I know can dive straight in and spitball ideas endlessly. I need to more fully understand a situation before I can do that. I need to see the bigger picture. I need to do some research. I need to talk with a few people and hear their perspectives. Otherwise I feel as though the ideas I generate are just built on “*Wouldn’t it be cool if . . .* ” propositions with little meaning. 
<br>—
<br>I want, and expect, more than that from myself and from the work my team produces.
<br>##
<br>
<br>They started firing out ideas and landing thoughts on the board, and I noticed my discomfort level start to rise.
<br>I understood how little I knew about the problem, the client’s needs, and the audience it wanted to reach.
<br>—
<br>I saw other people around thrilled.
<br>being an empathic problem solver takes many forms. There isn’t just one way to do it. Prehaps my problem was not inablity but inflexibility.
<br>
<br>She was good at creating space - she knew some people would want snacks, others liked a little music, others wanted to liad up on caffeine.
<br>She cued the music and poured the coffee before anyone else arrived. When you walked into a meeting with her, you could immediately drop into a state of comfort, and she had a much easier time getting the team to work with her toward a viable solution.
<br>
<br>-How could we better understand customers?
<br>-How can we build a culture benefitiong the individuals?
<br>—
<br>You can solve these questions only with empathy
<br>
<br>Many people work in organizations that still have outdated hierarchies and processes.
<br>
<br>Today’s most effective companies are flatter, more collaborative, and more dynamic than ever before.
<br>##
<br>
<br>With empathy, complex problems become more understandable, teams become more effective, and companies become more nimble.
<br>
<br>Leaders of such companies get more out of their teams because they recognize that this kind of dexterity is an essential part of our modern work style.
<br>
<br>No cross talk - stay fully present
<br>
<br>Inquirer archetype
<br>-Interrogate assumed truths
<br>-challenge preconvieved notions and push for deeper truths
<br>-They are deeply curious question askers who don’t stop at the first response but probe deeper, looking for more complete understanding. We saw this emerge in the mammography assignment when we began asking why the examination rooms were so cold. By asking this over and over, going deeper down the rabbit hole, we eventually reached an opportunity for improvement that was a key to our success.
<br>-Always intrigued by the “why” behind each answer, Inquirers dig and dig until they reach the root.
<br>
<br>Creating a sense of confidence is paramount to the work we do.
<br>-develop ability to observe and listen, simultaneously plan what to say next
<br>
<br>Seekers
<br> are daring. They are confident and fearless. Frankly, if we hadn’t had a bit of the Seeker running within us, we probably couldn’t have undertaken the mammography project at all.
<br>Entrepreneurs are inherent risk-takers, and they must dare in order to be successful.
<br>A boundless explorer, the Seeker bravely sets out on new adventures. The Seeker lives outside his or her comfort zone, acts with confidence and self-assurance. Embody the Seeker when embracing new experiences and daunting challenges, knowing that unfettering your pursuits will eventually lead you to the answer.

<br>We’d designed exclusive, ultrapremium retail lounges where high-end customers could create bespoke sneakers in a private suite alongside a Nike designer. We had established such a trusting relationship while working together
<br>
<br>he’d usually ask a sharp and powerful question such as “Why do you think I should care about any of this?” or “Who’s talking right now?” Those questions would knock me back abd rethink
<br>
<br>I thought about how most of us spend so much time trying to get a grasp on one another, but rarely do we take the time to delve deep and try to understand our own selves.
<br>
<br>Whole Self
<br>1. Physical self
<br>He was pushing me to get into touch with my physical presence, to inhabit the here and now, and to be in command of my own body. Without this sort of presence, any other more cerebral pursuits are futile.
<br>Use left hand as primary
<br>2. Emotional Self, 
<br>which connects us to our personal needs and our inner voice, giving us a means to achieve greater understanding
<br>Talk therapy is a great way to explore this realm of the self.
<br>3. Inspired Self 
<br>is the spark that ignites the inherent desire to make, to do, and to solve. We engage with this self when we establish goals or intentions. The deep sense of accomplishment you get fuels the Inspired Self and encourages us to set new goals.
<br>4. Community Self
<br>helps us understand how our individual self interacts with the world around us. What type of person are we at work? At home?
<br>Having grasped our physical, emotional, and inspired states of being, we can begin to look at how we fit within the context of the world around us.
<br>5. The Intellectual Self 
<br>helps put our emotions and senses into concepts and words that help us understand what’s going on inside us and relate more effectively to those around us.
<br>Asking questions
<br>6. Mindful Self
<br>raise our consciousness for the present moment, our relationship with the world around us in this moment, and our place in it.
<br>Interest in meditation
<br>7. Aspirational
<br>
<br>All selves define purpose
<br>Having a sense of our greater purpose is like the magnetism that keeps a compass needle pointing toward the north. With clarity of purpose, we can make choices and take actions clear-mindedly.
<br>
<br>Nike
<br>We wanted to have people really connect with the value of the Nike Free Hyperfeel, and to do that, we needed to have them appreciate the experience of being barefoot.
<br>Most people haven’t run barefoot,
<br>They don’t feel the ground, and they don’t have the sensorial connection to what’s below them.
<br>We had to lead people to empathy for the experience of being barefoot.
<br>We wanted to create a sensorial experience that would allow people to engage with the soles of their feet,
<br>
<br>We weren’t telling them what was going to happen inside, which made it even more challenging. 
<br>But we applied empathy in anticipating how they would react to what we were asking them to do, and we let them know that we actually wanted them to be skeptical. We didn’t want them to be easily convinced. We just hoped they would go into the experience with an open mind and see what happened.

<br>Measuring brain activity through walking theough different surfaces in darkness - sensors commected to phone
<br>Redults showed some of them walking on grass almost meditating. 
<br>Wanted to show how product can engage them with space around rhem
<br>Started sensing space around them
<br>This was goal - More than a product launch
<br>Rethinking their routines
<br>—
<br>Applying empathy with emphasis on the Whole Self, was an effective means of solving a problem.
<br>—
<br>Apply on all componemt, give experience of engaging with all parts of their being
<br>1. Focus on body level
<br>2. Textured, lights, sound - engage their emotions
<br>3. Inspire - little changes made huge impact on their routines, goals amd ambitions
<br>4. Community - want to talk to others
<br>5. Intellectual - new awareness, know how tech works
<br>6. Mindful - connect to the space around more intimately, feel the world around
<br>7. Aspirational - move underdtanding of self further. More commitment to push themselves
<br>
<br>Client type - most fun who are willing to take calculated risks when they believe those risks are in the best interest of the brand and the business. Nike is one of those clients.

<br>Questions
<br>What is your purpose? How was your past shaped? How do you deal with negative emotions?
<br>What do you want to know the most? When have your instincts led you astray? What do you continually askyourself?
<br>*What makes your experience meaningful?*
<br>What motivates you to progress? *When does your curiosity create difficulty?* What does approaching breakthrough feels like? Who has challenged you to bebetter than you once we're? *What is the biggest sacrifices you've ever made?*
<br>When is listeno´ing more valuable than counselling? *How do you build trust? What should people better understand about you?* When are you the most observant?
<br>*What mistake would you make again?* How do you explore your inner self? *Where do you go to push your limits?*
<br>*How do you build endurance?* What do you purposely leave undone? *Who are your long term partners?* What commitment have you made to yourself more than once? *When has mentorship played role in your life?* When do you feel the most nurtured?
<br>How do you build endurance?
<br>What do you purposely leave undone?

<br>Physical excercise
<br>Body scan
<br>For example, when you bring your attention to your feet, don’t just feel your feet, but feel everything about your feet. Feel the air around them, the ground below them. Feel the temperature of the room from your feet. Feel your toes and arches
<br>--
<br>Take three slow breaths again and open your eyes. Ask yourself how different you feel about your body relative to how you felt when you began the exercise. Do you have a different awareness for your physicality? Your breath? Take a moment to write down your feelings, and pay attention to how they change
<br>
<br>Emotional excercise
<br>ask what emotion you most commonly feel at work / at home / at all times—whatever setting is relevant to you.
<br>--
<br>Describe how this emotion makes the rest of you feel. How often do you feel this way? Can you control how often and when you feel this way? Does this emotion control you? Are there specific people who trigger this emotion in you? Why do they do so?
<br>--
<br>Understanding your emotions and what gives rise to them will ultimately help you manage them more acutely.
<br>It’s possible you could discover that this is a persistent emotion you don’t want controlling your life.
<br>
<br>CULTURE
<br>
<br>one important element that always plays a role in building a strong internal culture: alignment. When a company’s purpose is understood—truly understood at a strategic and emotional level—it permeates everything the organization does.
<br>
<br>1962 NASA’s Launch Operations Center on Merritt Island, Florida. President John F. Kennedy, who the year before had established an ambitious goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade, was touring the center. At one point he saw a janitor carrying a broom past the tour group. Kennedy stopped the man and said, “Hi, I’m Jack Kennedy. What do you do here?”
<br>“Well, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That is alignment.
<br>
<br>People aren’t simply coming to work to perform a specific function; they are bringing their full self to the entirety of the business and its mission. The best companies do this so well that it becomes infectious.
<br>
<br>Nike Campus
<br>Gatekeeper - He seemed like a character you’d encounter on the grounds of Disney World, not the gatekeeper at a corporate office. 
<br>He smiled and asked if I’d been to the campus before. I told him it was my first time, and he gave me a knowing look, the way someone does when he knows you’re in for a treat. I pulled into a massive parking lot and noticed a series of signs at the front. One of them read, “Reserved for Michael Jordan.” I was starstruck before I’d even made it out of the parking lot. I parked my car humbly, a few rows away from Michael Jordan’s spot, and went to meet my clients.
<br>The athlete and the people who had created the product were on the same pedestal.
<br>When in conference room meetings with them that felt like a locker room before a big game. The teams I’ve worked with at Nike were aligned to the greater mission established by the company’s founders.
<br>
<br>When Nike cofounder Bill Bowerman was asked to define “athlete,” he said, “If you have a body, you’re an athlete.” That is why Nike’s culture is so powerful. Bowerman democratized athleticism. You might not be the next LeBron James or Serena Williams, but you’re still important to the brand.
<br>Your amility to perform better
<br>Your empathy for your inner athlete no matter your skill level, is meaningful. And the fact that the company’s employees understand that importance, and come to work every day, whether it’s in marketing, design, or accounting, is what makes its culture so powerful.
<br>
<br>The teams work hard, and they expect the best from their colleagues. It’s not for everyone. In our time working for clients that have strong alignment, I’ve seen people leave because they weren’t the right fit. And that’s okay. Not every organization is a perfect fit for every employee. This sort of tension often arises when a company’s culture starts to become more clearly defined, felt, and lived by its people.
<br>
<br>General Assembly - co-working, running out of spaces
<br>The company could have taken more space on other floors or in other buildings, but its founders knew they would no longer be a community but a real estate business, which wasn’t their goal.
<br>Stumbled upon workshops
<br>There was great demand for the programs, which people loved, so the founders began a hard pivot toward a new business model centered around skills development and training.
<br>
<br>Human-centered versus ecosystemic thinking
<br>
<br>Decisions should be made subjectively
<br>That's where empathy comes in
<br>When things are subjective, there can be multiple right answers, which can be influenced by a person’s feelings and biases, which can lead to confusion and indecision. Perspective, personal taste, intuition, and a host of other individualized attributes play a role in making subjective decisions.
<br>Objective - narrow things through criteria and requirements --- passice, reactive leadership
