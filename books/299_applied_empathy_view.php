<br>Empathy
<br>-umderstanding, others points of view
<br>-not sympathy or being nice
<br>-rarely used together with business
<br>
<br>-understand customer needs and improve products with meaningful insights from newfound perspectives
<br>-collaborate better, understand skills and how to get most out of interactions
<br>
<br>CDs at brick and mortar stores, Napster and Lime more empathetic distribution system
<br>-when there's disruption, key players try to protect their market (personal computing, digital cameras, ride sharing, airbnb)
<br>
<br>But had they applied empathy more meaningfully in their decision-making, they could have recognized new and innovative ways to lead their businesses into the next era.
<br>
<br>Boring company, Elon Musk
<br>While all intellectuals envisioned a world of flying cars, he focus on building technologically advanced tunnelling businessdesigned to solve congested road problems by expanding them under ground
<br>These companies and their leaders understand how to use empathy to look at <strong>problems differently</strong> and create solutions that not only disrupt conventions but use empathy as a powerful tool.

<br>We asked more questions and weren’t surprised to learn that none of the people we interviewed had given much thought to the patient’s comfort. It wasn’t that they didn’t care about the patient, but it wasn’t their job to consider the patient. Their primary concerns were the machinery, the procedure, and the test results.

<br>We took our findings to GE and proposed that they grow their business by doing more than simply selling their product to hospitals and leaving it at that. They needed to take into consideration every aspect — from the terminology used by the staff to the gowns, the temperature, the lighting, and perhaps even the scent of the room.
<br>we were telling them that the way to improve their imaging business was not just by selling machines but by providing services that put their machines into the best, most empathically designed environments possible.

<br>... held on Thanksgiving weekend in Chicago. (An unempathic time and place for many conference attendees, but so be it.) 
<br>
<br>—-
<br>
<br>Empathy
<br>Establishing perspective. Dropping biases
<br>
<br>Better product - i may think of building functionality, customers want better price
<br>Experiment with various perspectives. There is no wrong
<br>
<br>We were building our plane while we were flying it
<br>
<br>We decided to male ourselves our best client.

<br>##
<br>
<br>I began looking for moments when my thoughts and actions were coming from an empathic place and realizing how often, to my disappointment, they were not.
<br>
<br>I spend a lot of my day cooking up ideas for clients that help solve their problems.
<br>If you throw me into a room with zero preparation and give me some markers and a whiteboard, I’m probably going to sit there staring at it for an hour or two before anything happens.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Creatives I know can dive straight in and spitball ideas endlessly. I need to more fully understand a situation before I can do that. <strong>I need to see the bigger picture</strong>. I need to do some research. I need to talk with a few people and hear their perspectives. Otherwise I feel as though the ideas I generate are just built on “<strong>Wouldn’t it be cool if . . .</strong> ” propositions with little meaning. 
<br>—
<br>I want, and expect, more than that from myself and from the work my team produces.
<br>##
<br>
<br>They started firing out ideas and landing thoughts on the board, and I noticed my discomfort level start to rise.
<br>I understood how little I knew about the problem, the client’s needs, and the audience it wanted to reach.
<br>—
<br>I saw other people around thrilled.
<br>being an empathic problem solver takes many forms. There isn’t just one way to do it. Prehaps my problem was not inablity but inflexibility.
<br>
<br>She was good at creating space - she knew some people would want snacks, others liked a little music, others wanted to liad up on caffeine.
<br>She cued the music and poured the coffee before anyone else arrived. When you walked into a meeting with her, you could immediately drop into a state of comfort, and she had a much easier time getting the team to work with her toward a viable solution.
<br>
<br>-How could we better understand customers?
<br>-How can we build a culture benefitiong the individuals?
<br>—
<br>You can solve these questions only with empathy
<br>
<br>Many people work in organizations that still have outdated hierarchies and processes.
<br>
<br>Today’s most effective companies are flatter, more collaborative, and more dynamic than ever before.
<br>##
<br>
<br>With empathy, complex problems become more understandable, teams become more effective, and companies become more nimble.
<br>
<br>Leaders of such companies get more out of their teams because they recognize that this kind of dexterity is an essential part of our modern work style.
<br>
<br>No cross talk - stay fully present
<br>
<br>Inquirer archetype
<br>-Interrogate assumed truths
<br>-challenge preconvieved notions and push for deeper truths
<br>-They are deeply curious question askers who don’t stop at the first response but probe deeper, looking for more complete understanding. We saw this emerge in the mammography assignment when we began asking why the examination rooms were so cold. By asking this over and over, going deeper down the rabbit hole, we eventually reached an opportunity for improvement that was a key to our success.
<br>-Always intrigued by the “why” behind each answer, Inquirers dig and dig until they reach the root.
<br>
<br>Creating a sense of confidence is paramount to the work we do.
<br>-develop ability to observe and listen, simultaneously plan what to say next
<br>
<br>Seekers
<br> are daring. They are confident and fearless. Frankly, if we hadn’t had a bit of the Seeker running within us, we probably couldn’t have undertaken the mammography project at all.
<br>Entrepreneurs are inherent risk-takers, and they must dare in order to be successful.
<br>A boundless explorer, the Seeker bravely sets out on new adventures. The Seeker lives outside his or her comfort zone, acts with confidence and self-assurance. Embody the Seeker when embracing new experiences and daunting challenges, knowing that unfettering your pursuits will eventually lead you to the answer.
<br>
<br>We’d designed exclusive, ultrapremium retail lounges where high-end customers could create bespoke sneakers in a private suite alongside a Nike designer. We had established such a trusting relationship while working together
<br>
<br>he’d usually ask a sharp and powerful question such as “Why do you think I should care about any of this?” or “Who’s talking right now?” Those questions would knock me back abd rethink
<br>
<br>I thought about how most of us spend so much time trying to get a grasp on one another, but rarely do we take the time to delve deep and try to understand our own selves.
<br>
<br>Whole Self
<br>1. Physical self
<br>He was pushing me to get into touch with my physical presence, to inhabit the here and now, and to be in command of my own body. Without this sort of presence, any other more cerebral pursuits are futile.
<br>Use left hand as primary
<br>2. Emotional Self, 
<br>which connects us to our personal needs and our inner voice, giving us a means to achieve greater understanding
<br>Talk therapy is a great way to explore this realm of the self.
<br>3. Inspired Self 
<br>is the spark that ignites the inherent desire to make, to do, and to solve. We engage with this self when we establish goals or intentions. The deep sense of accomplishment you get fuels the Inspired Self and encourages us to set new goals.
<br>4. Community Self
<br>helps us understand how our individual self interacts with the world around us. What type of person are we at work? At home?
<br>Having grasped our physical, emotional, and inspired states of being, we can begin to look at how we fit within the context of the world around us.
<br>5. The Intellectual Self 
<br>helps put our emotions and senses into concepts and words that help us understand what’s going on inside us and relate more effectively to those around us.
<br>Asking questions
<br>6. Mindful Self
<br>raise our consciousness for the present moment, our relationship with the world around us in this moment, and our place in it.
<br>Interest in meditation
<br>7. Aspirational
<br>
<br>All selves define purpose
<br>Having a sense of our greater purpose is like the magnetism that keeps a compass needle pointing toward the north. With clarity of purpose, we can make choices and take actions clear-mindedly.
<br>
<br>Nike
<br>We wanted to have people really connect with the value of the Nike Free Hyperfeel, and to do that, we needed to have them appreciate the experience of being barefoot.
<br>Most people haven’t run barefoot,
<br>They don’t feel the ground, and they don’t have the sensorial connection to what’s below them.
<br>We had to lead people to empathy for the experience of being barefoot.
<br>We wanted to create a sensorial experience that would allow people to engage with the soles of their feet,
<br>
<br>We weren’t telling them what was going to happen inside, which made it even more challenging. 
<br>But we applied empathy in anticipating how they would react to what we were asking them to do, and we let them know that we actually wanted them to be skeptical. We didn’t want them to be easily convinced. We just hoped they would go into the experience with an open mind and see what happened.

<br>This was goal - More than a product launch
<br>Rethinking their routines
<br>—
<br>Applying empathy with emphasis on the Whole Self, was an effective means of solving a problem.
<br>—
<br>Apply on all componemt, give experience of engaging with all parts of their being
<br>1. Focus on body level
<br>2. Textured, lights, sound - engage their emotions
<br>3. Inspire - little changes made huge impact on their routines, goals amd ambitions
<br>4. Community - want to talk to others
<br>5. Intellectual - new awareness, know how tech works
<br>6. Mindful - connect to the space around more intimately, feel the world around
<br>7. Aspirational - move underdtanding of self further. More commitment to push themselves
<br>
<br>Client type - most fun who are willing to take calculated risks when they believe those risks are in the best interest of the brand and the business. Nike is one of those clients.

<br>Questions
<br>What is your purpose? How was your past shaped? How do you deal with negative emotions?
<br>What do you want to know the most? When have your instincts led you astray? What do you continually askyourself?
<br><strong>What makes your experience meaningful?</strong>
<br>What motivates you to progress? <strong>When does your curiosity create difficulty?</strong> What does approaching breakthrough feels like? Who has challenged you to bebetter than you once we're? *What is the biggest sacrifices you've ever made?*
<br>When is listeno´ing more valuable than counselling? <strong>How do you build trust? What should people better understand about you?</strong> When are you the most observant?
<br>*What mistake would you make again?* How do you explore your inner self? <strong>Where do you go to push your limits?</strong>
<br>*How do you build endurance?* What do you purposely leave undone? <strong>Who are your long term partners?</strong> What commitment have you made to yourself more than once? <strong>When has mentorship played role in your life?</strong> When do you feel the most nurtured?
<br>How do you build endurance?
<br>What do you purposely leave undone?

<br>Physical excercise
<br>Body scan
<br>For example, when you bring your attention to your feet, don’t just feel your feet, but feel everything about your feet. Feel the air around them, the ground below them. Feel the temperature of the room from your feet. Feel your toes and arches
<br>--
<br>Take three slow breaths again and open your eyes. Ask yourself how different you feel about your body relative to how you felt when you began the exercise. Do you have a different awareness for your physicality? Your breath? Take a moment to write down your feelings, and pay attention to how they change
<br>
<br>Emotional excercise
<br>ask what emotion you most commonly feel at work / at home / at all times—whatever setting is relevant to you.
<br>--
<br>Describe how this emotion makes the rest of you feel. How often do you feel this way? Can you control how often and when you feel this way? Does this emotion control you? Are there specific people who trigger this emotion in you? Why do they do so?
<br>--
<br>Understanding your emotions and what gives rise to them will ultimately help you manage them more acutely.
<br>It’s possible you could discover that this is a persistent emotion you don’t want controlling your life.
<br>
<br>CULTURE
<br>
<br>one important element that always plays a role in building a strong internal culture: alignment. When a company’s purpose is understood—truly understood at a strategic and emotional level—it permeates everything the organization does.
<br>
<br>1962 NASA’s Launch Operations Center on Merritt Island, Florida. President John F. Kennedy, who the year before had established an ambitious goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade, was touring the center. At one point he saw a janitor carrying a broom past the tour group. Kennedy stopped the man and said, “Hi, I’m Jack Kennedy. What do you do here?”
<br>“Well, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” That is alignment.
<br>
<br>People aren’t simply coming to work to perform a specific function; they are bringing their full self to the entirety of the business and its mission. The best companies do this so well that it becomes infectious.
<br>
<br>Nike Campus
<br>Gatekeeper - He seemed like a character you’d encounter on the grounds of Disney World, not the gatekeeper at a corporate office. 
<br>He smiled and asked if I’d been to the campus before. I told him it was my first time, and he gave me a knowing look, the way someone does when he knows you’re in for a treat. I pulled into a massive parking lot and noticed a series of signs at the front. One of them read, “Reserved for Michael Jordan.” I was starstruck before I’d even made it out of the parking lot. I parked my car humbly, a few rows away from Michael Jordan’s spot, and went to meet my clients.
<br>The athlete and the people who had created the product were on the same pedestal.
<br>When in conference room meetings with them that felt like a locker room before a big game. The teams I’ve worked with at Nike were aligned to the greater mission established by the company’s founders.
<br>
<br>When Nike cofounder Bill Bowerman was asked to define “athlete,” he said, “If you have a body, you’re an athlete.” That is why Nike’s culture is so powerful. Bowerman democratized athleticism. You might not be the next LeBron James or Serena Williams, but you’re still important to the brand.
<br>Your amility to perform better
<br>Your empathy for your inner athlete no matter your skill level, is meaningful. And the fact that the company’s employees understand that importance, and come to work every day, whether it’s in marketing, design, or accounting, is what makes its culture so powerful.
<br>
<br>The teams work hard, and they expect the best from their colleagues. It’s not for everyone. In our time working for clients that have strong alignment, I’ve seen people leave because they weren’t the right fit. And that’s okay. Not every organization is a perfect fit for every employee. This sort of tension often arises when a company’s culture starts to become more clearly defined, felt, and lived by its people.
<br>
<br>General Assembly - co-working, running out of spaces
<br>The company could have taken more space on other floors or in other buildings, but its founders knew they would no longer be a community but a real estate business, which wasn’t their goal.
<br>Stumbled upon workshops
<br>There was great demand for the programs, which people loved, so the founders began a hard pivot toward a new business model centered around skills development and training.
<br>
<br>Human-centered versus ecosystemic thinking
<br>
<br>Decisions should be made subjectively
<br>That's where empathy comes in
<br>When things are subjective, there can be multiple right answers, which can be influenced by a person’s feelings and biases, which can lead to confusion and indecision. Perspective, personal taste, intuition, and a host of other individualized attributes play a role in making subjective decisions.
<br>Objective - narrow things through criteria and requirements --- passice, reactive leadership
<br>
<br>Mechanical engineering
<br>-discomfort with subjective vs objective decision making
<br>-eir´ther machine works or it doesn't. Either performs desired task or doesn't >judging objectively by results acieved
<br>-apply Empathy to be more comfortable with subjective work
<br>-*app development depends on ability to make objective and subjective decisions*
<br>-best products are not only stable but also offer pleasant experience
<br>##
<br>
<br>Utilize empathy
<br>The deeper you go, the strongest insights you see
<br>-look from perspective of someone - may see that city is designed for another needs and lacking yours. Soˇe even intervewed
<br>
<br>Top-down companies
<br>rigid command-and-control structure, with directives flowing from above and being implemented unquestioningly throughout the organization. Top-down organizations often benefit from the efficiencies of having only a few decision makers. But they can also struggle with low employee engagement and morale if individuals on low levels feel no real influence
<br>-for many companies works well: employees even tell us they sought out a culture like this because they could do their job more efficiently and would have clarity about their place in the company and how it operates.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Bottom up
<br>seek feedback from teams in both formal and informal ways. These organizations sometimes cultivate stronger, more inclusive cultures, but they can also struggle with too much information coming into the system, putting senior leaders into a state of “analysis paralysis” -- unsure of what to do and where to go based on mixed or divergent feedback.
<br>-picks up empathy points for elevating the voices of the whole organization and for taking employees’ perspectives into account when decisions are made.
<br>
<br>An effective corporate culture, if designed and communicated effectively, should behave like a magnet, attracting behaviors and talent that are aligned to the culture and repelling those that are not. And repelling is a good thing. It means you’re being clear about who you are and what you expect from people.
<br>
<br>Early days of company founder is the sun, holding company together, planets would spin out. Gives vision, light and warmth for growth.
<br>As company grows you start lose talent - it's impossible for him to remain sun.
<br>You need leaders to become sun of their teams
<br>Surround yourself with passionate people who believe in mission
<br>##
<br>
<br>Empathic companies have a true understanding of the dynamics at play on a variety of levels within the organization, and they know that great cultures are built by constantly calibrating the top-down aspects of their operations with the bottom-up feedback from the organization as a whole. Applying empathy to an organization or team is a constantly evolving process, but with careful attention, it can inspire and empower leaders to steward the company through change time and again.
<br>
<br>HUMAN-CENTERED VERSUS ECOSYSTEMIC THINKING
<br>- Ecosystematic - considering interconnected elements
<br>
<br>Hummer - human-centered design was working well. General Motorss capitalized on the demand of a specific audience who were clamoring for bigger, more visually powerful vehicles.
<br>The Hummer driver wanted to sit high and see the road from a powerful, in-command vantage point, and the vehicle was designed to provide that.
<br>
<br>Active vs Passive Leadership
<br>-managing tons of information, avoiding paralysis
<br>@How much is too much? 
<br>@How can companies determine the right level of information to consider before making a decision? 
<br>@What is the data informing, and how does that influence leadership decisions?
<br>
<br>Decisions come swiftly and often. Deadline-driven businesses seem to excel at it.
<br>
<br>The Internet turned journalism into a minute-to-minute business, have to make quick choices to stay in front of the competition. 
<br>
<br>Whenever we work with a client to help its team improve their approach to empathy, we first want to understand how they make decisions. We want to know if decisions are being made with adequate, empathic inputs (i.e., inputs beyond those of the decision makers themselves) or in a (relative) vacuum.
<br>
<br>Investment company
<br>Investment decision vote - They might be at various levels of seniority, but each person’s opinion is valued or they wouldn’t be in the room.
<br>-realtime ratings on everything, every ineraction
<br>-algoritms analyses how their investments and communication performed overtime /including group and individual/ and gives weights to their votes. - based on score company makes decision
<br>Bridgewater uses this sort of data every day to help its teams make more efficient and better-informed decisions about nearly everything.
<br>
<br>your success or failure in taking an empathic approach to leadership will rely heavily on your ability to shift the people, processes, and principles of the company to align more fully with the newfound perspective that empathy has given you.
<br>Longest lasting institutions - governments, militaries, and religions -succeeded because of benefit of autocratically dictating environment they operate in
<br>Businesses - have to constantly adapt to survive
<br>
<br>Chinese medicine - acupuncture
<br>I walked outside an hour later feeling entirely different. I still had pain in my back, but something had shifted. I felt connected to my body again. I knew this was what I needed if I hoped to fix my back—as well as, perhaps, the rest of my life.
<br>
<br>Real healing doesn’t come from the practitioner; it comes from you. It comes when you awaken to your whole self and allow your system to repair itself.
<br>my teachers taught me that our job is not to heal but to put our patients into a position to heal themselves.
<br>our best work occurs not when we fix everything for our clients but when we empower them with the tools and the clarity to fix their own teams, products, culture, or business.
<br>
<br>“It’s going to capture attention, but attention isn’t going to change our business on its own.” He wanted our help in turning that attention into action.
<br>
<br>We wanted to find people who were embodying that spirit of progress and hard work and pull them into a new conversation, one that celebrated their sense of craft, of making things, of the integrity that comes from doing that kind of work well.
<br>
<br>We knew we were going into the unknown, like the gold panners of the nineteenth century, and similarly we knew something about what we’d find but not everything.
<br>But for the workshops we decided to celebrate a different side of the sport. We collaborated with the San Francisco Giants and Topps, an iconic baseball card manufacturer, to design and print a set of cards that praised the off-field accomplishments of San Francisco’s athletes.
<br>
<br>He had just been walking past and was curious.
<br>
<br>It was exciting to see this brand’s origin story come alive in this new and modern way.
<br>
<br>Levi’s Workshops went up in Mumbai, Paris, Rio, and other markets where the brand needed to connect to the local community and tell the story of its roots.
<br>Tell story Through actions not words
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>CONNECTING BRAND with STORY
<br>
<br>Understand why he or she started the business in the first place. What was the point? You might be surprised to hear that this person has a different story than the one you were told in your HR orientation.
<br>
<br>Use this as an opportunity to question convention and challenge the language and the traditions you see your organization using. Make sure that they are actually true to the company’s legacy
<br>
<br>I’ve observed so many companies that have gotten lost in their own jargon—bandying about staid buzzwords such as “innovation” and “disruption” that have meaning to only a few people in the company.
<br>
<br>ask yourself what you can do to change the lexicon or ingrained behaviors that are keeping you, your team, or your company from growing and align it back to the origins of the brand.
<br>##
<br>
<br>Sometimes companies fail to capture the real parts of their origins and the wrong things get carried forward.
<br>-company that had a policy of issuing checks only every other Tuesday. --causing them to run up outrageous sums in late-payment fees.
<br>policy had been used in the business from its beginnings, and it had been accepted unquestioningly for decades.
<br>-discovered that in the company’s early days, they had a part-time bookkeeper who worked only every other Tuesday. That little detail had solidified into an unchecked and dysfunctional policy that was hurting the daily operations of a global company.
<br>
<br>We also have traditions that keep us focused on what really matters.
<br>
<br>Fresh eyes - That perspective doesn’t last forever, so we take this opportunity to ask them what they see that we do well, what we could do better, what’s confusing, and what’s refreshing.
<br>
<br>Connecting to the story
<br>Traditions
<br>start by documenting two to three of your team’s or organization’s traditions, being sure to include the details of their origins, why the company continues to do them, and what they add to the overall culture of the business.
<br>Are some traditions actually causing pain in the current business?
<br>
<br>*Should the tradition be designed to add to or subtract from the issue?* 
<br>For example, if you have too many pointless meetings, you might consider a monthly tradition of evaluating and editing down all current meetings.
<br>
<br>*Should the tradition work with your internal team, or would you be better served by creating a tradition that includes an external party?* 
<br>Consider inviting your customers or clients into the new tradition to help broaden participants’ perspectives.
<br>
<br>The best leaders, like the best leaders, use empathy to do their job well. They know which players thrive on discipline and which ones need more gentle mentorship.
<br>
<br>Helping coaches to improve:
<br>1. Introduce them 7 archetypes and ask to identify thekselves
<br>2. Give them cards with archetypes - match with their empathetic strengths and weaknesses - they started talking about their improvements
<br>
<br>We also helped the client understand that innovation often requires operational change, but those changes rarely translate into profitability within a quarter or two. It takes time—sometimes years—before innovation yields results. 
<br>
<br>Teams that are evaluated on a quarterly profit-and-loss basis will be reluctant to take bold risks and challenge convention. 
<br>
<br>To change a culture, it can sometimes be necessary to support innovation on a financial and personal performance basis. 
<br>to establish new policies that would give its teams permission to take calculated risks and, at times, accept a loss before obtaining long-term growth. 
<br>
<br>There is a benefit of working from an empathic place to act upon their initial instinct to shift into a more innovative culture. 
<br>empathy and innovation are not magic wands. They take time, dedication, and continuing recommitment to make them a core part of a company’s DNA.
<br>
<br>Building a campaign with empathy begins with asking ourselves: 
<br>-We want to understand who we’re talking to, how they consume content (e.g., via social media, through advertising), and what we want to say to them once we have their attention.
<br>
<br>MARKETING COMMUNICATION
<br>
<br>Fashion brand social channel
<br>-<strong>overfocused on sales</strong>
<br>-pressure from the company’s sales and leadership teams to drive more sales through social media.
<br>-“<strong>Imagine if every time we hung out together, all I talked about was my clothes. How often would we hang out?</strong>”
<br>-We looked for other topics for which the brand shared a passion with its consumers, and we landed on music, design, and food. As a test, the media people swapped their sales promotion content for conversations with their followers about their favorite new bands, artists, and restaurants.
<br>-Within weeks, the company regained its lost audience and began adding new followers to its social media outlets; most important, it established an authentic connection that carried over to its product. Its consumers came to believe that the brand understood them. And guess what? Sales started to rise.
<br>
<br>Authenticity 
<br>- if you don't talk about your customers, there is something wrong (Ms)
<br>When people connect authentically, bringing about a shared understanding of each other, the greater the likelihood is that everyone will get what they are looking for.
<br>
<br>How you do that is by applying empathy and anticipating what your consumers want from the relationship. How often do they want to hear from you? 
<br>Should your communication be personalized at this stage of the relationship? 
<br>What channels do they want you to use? 
<br>Will those be uniform, or will they be different depending on customers and their preferences? 
<br>Successful brands know how important it is to use empathy when considering these questions while creating external campaigns. They know that consumers have only so much time for any one company and realize that they will be drawn to the ones that take their time, interests, and relationships into consideration.
<br>
<br>Treat yourself as your best client
<br>What would you do differently?
<br>
<br>Each week we meet with different departments, which gives us a chance not only to check on specific work in progress but also to meet with each team. 
<br>How are we doing? 
<br>What are we struggling with? In what ways can we help one another? 
<br>I know this isn’t revolutionary, but it’s surprising how uncommon it is. In my experiences working with companies, it’s rare for executives to take the time to regularly check in with the members of their teams on a personal level and seek to truly understand how each person is doing.
<br>
<br>Empathic Leadership
<br>
<br>The best leaders I’ve observed make an effort to understand what’s going on with the people on their teams on a personal level—their goals, fears, hopes, and dreams; everyone has them. Time and again, I’ve seen great leaders do this as a way of building deeper, more meaningful relationships with the people around them. 
<br>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, is someone who is (rightly) praised for his ability to lead this way. He’s brought empathy into the center of Microsoft’s organization, using it as a tool to reorient the business and listen to feedback from within the company as well as the world around it.
<br>
<br>CLEAR framework for conversations
<br>
<br>“Check in,” we make sure it’s the right time for feedback and all parties involved are in the right headspace to have this sort of conversation. 
<br>*Getting present*
<br>“Lead with data” reminds everyone to start the conversation  <strong>with facts, not subjectively with feelings or opinion</strong>. 
<br>With the first two in place, it’s time for “Emotion” to be revealed, with each person saying how he or she feels about a given issue or topic. “Agreement” is a step designed to bring about common ground. You could think of this as the “empathy” step, where we look at the <strong>situation from the other person’s perspective</strong> and look for the place where our views align. 
<br>We end with “Resolution,” the moment when we discover how we can move forward together. This may not be a surprising approach to conflict resolution, but interestingly, we have found it helpful to consider when there’s positive feedback to deliver.
<br>--
<br> Over time, CLEAR conversations have become second nature to us, and we don’t always have to go through the five steps overtly because each element is integrated into our behavior. 
<br>Rituals such as Sub Rosa Day and CLEAR have delivered meaningful results to both our company and our culture. They foster a sense of empathy in our interpersonal relationships because they show that we are invested in taking the time to understand where each of us needs support.

<br>Mentorship
<br>
<br>I’m talking about is finding and connecting to people in your life who are truly valuable: people you need or who need you and with whom you can work reciprocally to give and receive feedback.
<br>
<br>My best mentors never forced their dogma or views onto me. Instead, they listened intently.
<br>
<br>Correct answer: “Here’s how I would do it.”
<br>
<br>the real gift an empathic leader can impart to someone else is a perspective on his or her own challenges so that the person being mentored can learn to see things in fresh ways.
<br>
<br>I run 3 company, one would say I have no focus
<br>-
<br>What I’m really good at is helping people identify obstacles that stand in the way of their progress and then finding solutions that remove those obstacles. 
<br>Sometimes that means creating a new marketing campaign or reviving a company culture.
<br> I’ve even helped a few couples who have wandered into our shop figure out how to make their house feel more like a home. Different media, same skill.
<br>
<br>The days of working at one company for your entire career are over. In today’s world, it’s entirely acceptable to take multiple paths and pursue different passions across the life cycle of your career.
<br>
<br>I tell people who come to me for advice to look for consistent themes that emerge in your life and your interactions with others and to use them to push yourself toward satisfying work.
<br>
<br>across all the various things I do—to recognize that problem-solving with empathy is my core skill. Take a moment to reflect on your life and what seems to pull you in different directions or cause you to compartmentalize yourself. What is the consistent theme or idea shared by these seemingly divergent directions?
<br>
<br>I had no idea I could work in indigenous medicine or run an award-winning studio. I had to try. 
<br>I had to trust that the empathy I had for myself and my innate gifts was accurate enough for me to start my own business when I was twenty-three years old and that it was a risk worth taking.
<br>
<br>Admittedly, it’s a relatively unscientific theory, but so far I’ve found it to be true. Everyone has powerful gifts waiting to be unlocked. Try some of the different empathic archetypes, and do some self-inquiry. See what happens when you look at yourself through the lens of the Inquirer or the Alchemist.

<br>Pantone
<br>“are you An ink-and-chemical company?” You see, to us Pantone is so much more than just ink and chemicals. It represents the integrity of design, the inspiration that comes from color, the universe of possibilities that creators can play with when developing a new campaign or product or brand.
<br>-
<br>We could see immediately that the brand had lost the spirit of what it really represented.
<br>-
<br>Those executives weren’t at fault; they were simply too inside their own company to see it the way we—the design community that relies on Pantone—see it.
<br>-
<br>We needed to help them remember why they had started working there in the first place. They needed a new perspective from which they could see the company with fresh eyes. And empathy would help us get there together.
<br>
<br>We began digging into all areas of the company, from messaging and marketing to products and services, business metrics, internal culture,...
<br>It's important to build this sort of broad foundation because you never know where insights will emerge.
<br>
<br>Our close look at the Color of the Year revealed Pantone’s savant gift. It was hiding right there in plain sight. The world saw it, but the company had <strong>become so locked into the day-to-day of its business that it hadn’t been able to see it.</strong>
<br>The Color of the Year is Applied Empathy in action. Pantone gathers its understanding of the world around it from its customers and its own internal knowledge and uses that to present a fresh perspective on the core of its business: color. It just didn’t realize it was doing that.
<br>Company's authority in color intelligence
<br>
<br>We suggested that if the company wanted its brand to stand for something new, an update to the brand identity would be a powerful signal that the company was undergoing an evolution.
<br>“Make it Brilliant” refers not only to the company’s legacy as color experts, but also to the importance of color intelligence and forecasting in its growth plan.
<br>
<br>which meant we’d need to stay on a relatively shoestring budget until we had a couple wins to our credit.
<br>
<br>Our <strong>research as well as our perspective on the brand told us that there were consumers out there who were desperate to</strong> interact with the brand in a more meaningful way but were not getting anything
<br>
<br>Applying empathy, we <strong>put ourselves into the perspective of the entire design community</strong> (designers, decorators, architects, and so on)—not such a stretch for a shop like ours but an important step to ensure that we were seeing the matter from all angles. <strong>We challenged ourselves to consider</strong> surprising ways Pantone could show up in the world while still being true to its brand. At the same time, we noted how often the world of design changes seasonally.
<br>
<br>sparking new conversations, behaviors, relationships, and memories in all kinds of ways. The B2B community was appreciating the full value of Pantone’s expertise in color and trend forecasting, which had already led to increased sales of the company’s products and services. Those customers realized that the Pantone they had known and trusted over the years now had much more to offer. 
<br>All of that new engagement and growth was bringing about a “perfect storm” of success that simultaneously enlivened the spirit of the internal culture.
<br>executives who only six months earlier had called Pantone an “ink-and-chemical company.” Now they were beaming, asking each other things such as “Is this ‘brilliant’ enough?” and “<strong>How can we inspire more people</strong> with color?”
<br>--
<br>-leverage strength - Sparks pride and boosts morale
<br>-became seen as authority - value on top of the product
<br>-company being fixed on day to day worked stopped noticing value for customer
<br>
<br>When we fix a problem, we should also deliver to the client enough tools, lessons, and empowerment that they can begin to own their own future.
<br>-Help with recruiting - people forked in sub Rosa first to learn the job before they started at pantone
<br>
<br>Agencies
<br>Long term clients
<br>the agency people analyzing whether hours are burning high, pushing the agency team to the brink, or burning low and the client wondering if it is getting its money’s worth. It’s a constant calibration contest and a highly unempathic way of managing a partnership.
