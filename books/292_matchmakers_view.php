<br>Traditional economic formulas are wrong for multisided marketplace.
<br>Chicken and egg problem, build supply first, reward demand
<br>Traditional - never get profitable to sell less than cost. Paying customers rather than charging can be profitable.
<br>15
<br>Mulyisided marketpkaces attract multiple types of customers and enabling them to interact.
<br>
<br>Multisided platforms:
<br>Shopping mallls - connecting consumers and retaolers
<br>Windows OS - connects app developers and end users
<br>Fashion magazines - connect women with interest in fashion with companies selling fashion and accessories.
<br>18
<br>
<br>Direct network effect: the more people connected to the network, the more valuable is the network to a person who is  part of it
<br>#
<br>22
<br>
<br>Economits argue if two standards were roughly comparable in cost and performance, consers would find standard used byore people more attractive
<br>(VHS vs Betamax, Uber vs Lyft)
<br>23
<br>
<br>The poorer technology can win because is first or just because of the power of network effects.
<br>23
<br>
<br>Bitcoin.
<br>If you want to be a winner who takes all, you'd better start first and keep ypur lead.
<br>24
<br>
<br>Direct network effect negatives
<br>Creates competition between members for matches. Customers would prefer less competition.
<br>Incentives to limit competition to become more valuable for members.
<br>29
<br>###
<br>
<br>Need to have enough participants on each sides. Can't do that just by getting more participants. Have to make sure they're getting more participants for each side with whom participants on the other side want to interact.
<br>30
<br>#
<br>
<br>Have enough supply at the right time and right place.
<br>Esp if you offer local services - Lyft, Yelp
<br>
<br>If mall developer wants to create a high end shopping mall, it must attract highend stores to lease space and persuade well-off shoppers to go there.
<br>Packing the mall with people who arent able to shop wont help persuade high end stores to rent the space.
<br>30
<br>
<br>Some people may think that subsidies and free prices are gimmick that platforms use to get a critical mass.
<br>In fact, its common that negative prices are charged permanently to maximize profits.
<br>33
<br>
<br>Platforms are selling connections.
<br>-
<br>Zappos - liknks consumers and shoe manufacturers.
<br>It found it could offer a more conskstent experience for buyers by taking full control of the buyer experience
<br>35
<br>
<br>Friction. China 1980. Evonomic reforms. Small private businesses.
<br>Low Annual income limits the market. Communication - internet starting, low penetration of phones. Cant depend on slow moving legal system - judges and lawyers with no knowledge of private business.
<br>As a business owner you depend on personal relations with partners. Use cash for buying and selling. Sell to companies near your company.
<br>56
<br>
<br>Value.
<br>Multisided platform doesnt only needs to be worthy for all its side, it also needs to give them enough value to want to participate.
<br>Sometimes it requires to heavily subsidy one group ( cant make money from them)
<br>57
<br>##
<br>
<br>Fundamentally platforms create value by reducing frictions.
<br>57
<br>##
<br>
<br>Reduce friction -> create value for user (make life easy) -> get revenue
<br>(Gmail for businesses)
<br>-
<br>Values for businesses: communicate, consummate transactions, measure trust in their partners 
<br>(see doing business in china in 1980s)
<br>- the less friction, the more expansion
<br>60
<br>
<br>China 2000.
<br>Evonomic growth, households got richer, had limited ways to spend money. Only few malls in the country.
<br>Alibaba helped to filled the gap by sophisticated marketplace, transaction handling, shipping and enabling trust.
<br>Integrated b2b and b2c. No one else successfully did.
<br>US b2b marketplaces were collapsing at that time. 
<br>Frictions were not significant to get enough buyers and sellers. There werent enough transactions, exchanges didnt grow and disnt get positive feedback of the network effect.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Critical mass - momentum
<br>A lot of it comes to momentum.
<br>If other people think a night club is doing a good jobat gettimg men and women join, nightclub's following will grow and get to critical mass.
<br>Without momentum, the more people will perceive it as a dead spot.
<br>Makes harder to turn things around
<br>73
<br>#
<br>
<br>Securing critical mass ses easy in retrospect, but its the most difficult thing.
<br>
<br>Youtube.
<br>When figured out to secure critical mass of people to uoload and share videos ignited exponential growth. Other video sharing startups started failing.
<br>-
<br>Uploaded own videos and shared with friends. First video "me in the zoo". Dating component - to attract oppodite sex. Failed
<br>-
<br>Reduced friction in sharing and accessing videos. Embed on blogs, email links, listing videos in categories, promoting latest videos.
<br>Made it easy for people to make videos for friends and encouraging to create more videos.
<br>-
<br>Attracted by fast streams, featured videos and RECENT videos (watched a few secs before)
<br>-
<br>Business model - free for everyone. Building fraffic. Once there is critical mass, will become attractive for advertisors.
<br>74
<br>
<br>Sevuring critical mass strategies:
<br>1 Zigzag - emgage customer A and B simultameously
<br>YouTube, Alibaba
<br>2 Two-Step - persuade one group to join, once you have enough members persuade other group
<br> Advertising business model - newspapers, mAgazines (invest into content, then attract advertisers)
<br>3 Commitment - convince one group to make investments before other group can join
<br>App Stores, Shopping malls - attract foot traffic early on, persuade retailers to rent space
<br>-
<br>- convince members that if they join, the othrr group will be there too - if it works, it creates momentum.
<br>-
<br>The platform can supply one side itself - youtube: uploading own videos, app store: publishing own apps
<br>80
<br>#
<br>
<br>Free isnt new as a business strategy. Existed for centuries. Shopping malls, many newspapers, yellow pages, credot cards,...Internet enabled more rapid formation of multisided platforms and cheaper delivery services. For many, cost of processing transaction or managing an additional participant is low or zero.
<br>94
<br>
<br>Platform may pay members of "nice to meet" group to join, to increase number of "desperate to meet".
<br>Why nightclubs allow women free entry or free drinks.
<br>96
<br>
<br>Charges: access fees and usage fees.
<br>
<br>Platforms often do not charge access fees groups whose participation creates positive network effect (Amex, merchants). When there are access fees, they are combined with zero or negative usage fees (amex, cardholders)
<br>97
<br>
<br>Newspaper. Rebalaning charges in 2000s.
<br>With growth of the web made both sides sensitive to tyeir pricing.
<br>Newspapers responded by rebalancing their prices.
<br>99
<br>
<br>Successful pioneers dont start woth a master plan. They make decisions as they go. If they are lucky, they diacover successful strategies.
<br>
<br>Just starting a 2sided platform and securing participants is not enough. Google and Apple needed to providea healthy ecosystem.
<br>#
<br>Symbian - fragmented by carriers and manufacturers, impossible to roll out global innovations. Nightmare to develop apps for hundreds of carriers and handsets 
<br>Apple - total control of handsets. Jobs initially refused other devs to create apps that couldess it up, infect with viruses and pollute its integrity.
<br>In exchange for full control (carriers couldnt install their apps), gave at&t exclusivity for distribution - only 25percent market share 
<br>Android - attract carriers anfld handset makers to compete with apple. Sustem released under open license for free and to modify as they wanted.
<br>Launched as a framework, not as a phone with cool apps and features
<br>112
<br>
<br>In order to succeed, figure out how to increase chances that participants will be able to find each other and engage in mutually benefitial exchanges by design.
<br>The art and science varies from business to business. Some basic principles were identified that always apply.
<br>122
<br>
<br>Provide thick market - where niche or large volume items can be easily exchanged.
<br>Restaurant reservation platform must have enough of the right restaurants, in the right city, at the right time. Cannot make up for this deficit by having many restaurants that are not relevant.
<br>- screen participants: make your offer relevant to right group.
<br>124
<br>
<br>Limit platform for congestion - difficult for participants to find and interact for platform size.
<br>- make it easy to connect faster. Use technology for that
<br>125
<br>#
<br>Search engines: showing too many items makes it harder for people to find things, since each additional thing adds congestion.
<br>126
<br>##
<br>
<br>Platform's design needs to do more tgan help get enough of the right participants.
<br>It also has to make sure interactions happen between them.
<br>126
<br># lower the barriers
<br>
<br>Platforms that push unwilling participant with willing one.
<br>Magazine. Price at newsstand doesnt cover the cost of printing and distributing and generating content.
<br>Advertisimg subsidised that. Advertisers reach out to you altgohgh it causes yousome inconvenience.
<br>129
<br>
<br>Just like in any community, members can do bad things to each other.
<br>Impose rules and penalize when they obey.
<br>Successful platforms nurture positive begaviour externalities and minimize the negative ones, particularly by discouraging participants from behaving badly.
<br>136
<br>
<br>Behavior externalities
<br>Having someone on platform doesnt make others happier, sadder or affect at all.
<br>Noisy neighbor doing gardening however can significantly affect their happiness.
<br>
<br>Interactions become risky when platform participants arent trustworthy.
<br>Platforms can deal eith that by preventing low quality entrants to join.
<br>-
<br>Steve Jobs waas worried that iphone would attract low quality apps that would decrease value of platform.
<br>Apple solved this by imposing quality control on the apps.
<br>139
<br>#
<br>
<br>BlaBlaCar - ride sharing service, strangers travel together in cars.
<br>Has great pains to deal with this concern - verifies identities, requires to supply photographs, has drivers and riders rate each other after trip.
<br>Ladies Only feature to address females concerns
<br>140
<br>
<br>1. Whats the friction, how big is it, who will benefit from solving?
<br>2. How does platform solve the friction?
<br>Online video, many players saw the frictuin, only youtube succeeded. Others maybe chose bad design, bad pricing or didnt figure out how to work with other actors in broader ecosystem.
<br>3. Whats plan for achieving a critical mass?
<br>Its possible to design a platform that could create a great value. Platform doesnt generate valuevfor anyone unless right participants join. Once platform gets bad reputation its hard to recover
<br>4. Are you ready to modify design based on market response fast enough?
<br>
<br>Warning signs
<br>Ybey switched from grabbing all eyeballs to go narrow-go deep : create thick markets in a few cities.
<br>#
<br>156
<br>
<br>Apple Pay - go broad-go shallow.
<br>Weak network of merchant, while iphone penetration was good eniugh.
<br>
<br>A young man signs up for MPESA, so he could send money to his parents.
<br>Service is worthless for him until his parents are willing to use it.
<br>
<br>Burberry
<br>How can we use digital innovation to engage our customers more effectivelyin our physical real estate as well as onlune?
<br>Focus on millenials at 20s
<br>In emerging economies where the wealthier people tend to be younger.
<br>-
<br>Physical stores resemble online environment and made online platforms more like its physical stores?
<br>195
<br>
<br>Airbnb.
<br>What they have in common is that tgey are matching up people who have spare capacity (extra room, car, landmover) with people who would benefit from that spare capacity.
<br>198
<br>
<br>- matchmakers have been around for millenia
<br>- a lot of what they do is old stuff. They just use  tech to improve on those things
<br>- modert information and communication technologies have turbocharged the multisided platform model
<br>- history shows that todays sharing-economy matchmakers wont be the last to make waves 
<br>199
<br>
<br>Teoegraph was far more important platform in terms of its impact on global economy.
<br>When you look at todays  matchmakers, dont fall in illusion that all the good stuff have been invented.
<br>203
<br>
<br>Credit cards havent replaced cash. - 26 percent cash transactions in the US.
<br>Ecommerce havent replaced brick and mortar stores. - Some did die but physical retail still accounts for majority of retail purchases
<br>204
<br>
<br>How is platform designed to promote interactions among participants?
<br>#
<br>How does platform create value?
<br>How does platform use prices to balance participation?
<br>Does it have a subsidy side?
<br>Does it have rules and standards, how do they affect ability to create value?
<br>How does the system engage the broader ecosystem that afftcts its ability to create value?
<br>
<br>- have rifght answers before you start
<br>- learn quickly as you feel how participants respond
