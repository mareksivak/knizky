The Design of Everyday Things
<br>Donald Norman
<br>
<br>2 characteristics of good design - 
<br>discoverability (of possible actions, where and how to perform)
<br>Understanding (how is product supposed to be used? What do controls mean?)
<br>-
<br>Design of door should indicate how to use without signs or needfor trial and error. Bad door design - i push doors that are meant to be pulled, walk into doors that slide. Illustrates how Discoverability fails
<br>-
<br>With doors that push, designer should provude signals that indicate where to push. No need to destroy aesthetics - put a vertical plate on the side to be pushed.
<br>2
<br>
<br>If people use basic features because they are scared by complexity, whole purpose of design is lost. 
<br>4
<br>
<br>Experience Design - designing product with focus on quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
<br>-
<br>Interaction design - focus on how people use and understand product.
<br>-
<br>Industrial design - optimize function, value, appearance for mutual benefit if user and manufacturer
