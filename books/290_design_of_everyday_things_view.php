<br>2 characteristics of good design - 
<br>discoverability (of possible actions, where and how to perform)
<br>Understanding (how is product supposed to be used? What do controls mean?)
<br>-
<br>Design of door should indicate how to use without signs or needfor trial and error. Bad door design - i push doors that are meant to be pulled, walk into doors that slide. Illustrates how Discoverability fails
<br>-
<br>With doors that push, designer should provude signals that indicate where to push. No need to destroy aesthetics - put a vertical plate on the side to be pushed.
<br>2
<br>
<br>If people use basic features because they are scared by complexity, whole purpose of design is lost. 
<br>4
<br>
<br>Experience Design - designing product with focus on quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
<br>-
<br>Interaction design - focus on how people use and understand product.
<br>-
<br>Industrial design - optimize function, value, appearance for mutual benefit if user and manufacturer
<br>5
<br>##
<br>
<br>We design for people. We have to understand both people and technology.
<br>Thats difficult for engineers - machines are so logicql.
<br>I watched people struggle with technology. It became clear that difficulties were caused by technology, not the people 
<br>7
<br>
<br>Human Centric Design. Affordance.
<br>How could designers desvribe what they were doing?
<br>I put an affordance here - to indicate where on screen a person should touch.
<br>No, this is not an affordance. Affordance of touching exists on entire screen: you are trying to signify WHERE the touch should take placem That's not the same thing as saying WHAT action is possible.
<br>.
<br>- affordance/signifier: provides clues, signify meaningful information. Signifiers signal things, what actions are possible and how. Should be perceivable, else they fail to function
<br> Good design requires communication of purpose
<br>14
<br>
<br>If something as simple as doors requires signifiers, it indicates bad design.
<br>Horizontal bar perceive affordance of pushing
<br>
<br>If users dont click or swipe - the affordance is already there, they cant discevered it. You may want to add signifier - a sign telling what and where to do it.
<br>(Hand written sign pasted on doors)
<br>#
<br>
<br>Too much feedback may be more annoying than too little.
<br>Important messages are lost, annoying, tend to ignoration
<br>Dishwasher beeping at 3am defeats the goal of having it work in the middle of the night.
<br>-
<br>Rather than multiple signal lights, informative displays or rich musical patterns, focus on reduction - use a single light, one flash means two rapid flashes something else, long flash,..
<br>Same with sound - different states signalled by different beeping...
<br>- what do all these patterns mean?
<br>- how can someone learn and remember tgem?
<br>-
<br>Feedback has to be planned. Unimportant info - unobtrusive fashion, important signals - have to be prioritized and presented to capture attention.
<br>25
<br>#
<br>
<br>Model.
<br>Jighly simplified explanation, doesnt have to be accurate as long as its useful.
<br>Mental model - represent understanding how things work. Different people may hold different models of the same thing.
<br>26 
<br>
<br>Innovation:
<br>- incremental enhancement of existing products
<br>- radical ideas: reconsidering rhe goals, always asking what the real goal is - root cause analysis.
<br>43
<br>
<br>People dont want to drills. They want holes.
<br>Perhaps they want to hang shells on the wall.
<br>Why not to develop methods that dont require holes? Or perhaps books that dont require bookshelves?
<br>44
<br>
<br>------
<br>
<br>Cognition.
<br>In calm, non-threatening situations, the emotional system releases hormons to relax the muscles and bias the brain toward exploration and creativity. Now the brain is more apt to notice changes in environmentand piece together evenys yhat might have seemed unrelated earlier.
<br>-
<br>In tense,threatening situations brain focuses only on relevant parts of the environment. Muscles tense in preparation for action.
<br>48
<br>#
<br>
<br>3 levels of cognition:
<br>1. Lizard brain (visceral level)
<br>- Basic protective mechanisms, quick judgements
<br>(Fear of heights, dislike of dark and noisy environments, dislike of bitter and liking of sweet tastes,...)
<br>- Appearances matter: sight, sound, smell, taste - attraction or repulsion
<br>- Design: nothing with usability. Great designers use aesthetic sensibilities to drive visceral responses
<br>#
<br>50
<br>
<br>2. Behavioral level
<br>- learned skills, subconcious actions
<br>- even though we are aware of actions, we are unaware of details. When we speak, oftenwe do not know what we are going to say until we hear
<br>- when we perform well learned actiin, we have a goal in mind and concious level handles all details: concious mind has a little or no awareness.
<br>- all you know is you willed the action and correct thing happened (to pick up a cup you automatically adjust the fingers to make the thing possible) 
<br>- Designers: every action is associated with expectation. 
<br>Give positive response if positive outcome is expected. Information in feedback loop confirms or disconfirms expectation - result is satisfaction, relief, disappointment or frustration.
<br>Feedback provides reassurement, even when it indicates negative result. Lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of control; feedback sets expectations
<br>51
<br>#
<br>#there is always outcome in mind. always provide a feedback as a reassurement
<br>
<br>3. Reflective.
<br>Concious reactions. Offten occured after events have happened.
<br>- highest level of emotions
<br>- Design: most important to focus on
<br>- too much frustration may overlook positive outcome in the end. Positive response may take attention from difficulties - "attractive things work better"
<br>
<br>Badly designed products can induce frustration, anger, even hate
<br>Well-designed products can induce pride and enjoyment, feeling of control and pleasure, even love and attachment.
<br>55
<br>#
<br>
<br>Emotion states.
<br>When results of our actions are evaluated against expectations, resulting emotions affect our feelings as we continue through cycles of action.
<br>-
<br>Each task is characterized by level of difficulty.
<br>- too difficult task (far above skill level) causes frustration, anxiety, helplessness (too many failed expectations)
<br>- task far below skill level - easy to make expectations, no challenge. Little processing effort required , leads to boredom and apathy.
<br>- when activity slightly exceeds our skill level, so full attention is required, continual progress, success can be engaging.
<br>56
<br>#
<br>
<br>People form stories (conceputal models) to explain what they observed.
<br>In the absence of external information,people can run their imagination run free as long as tveir conceptual models account for facts they perceive.
<br>59
<br>
<br>Some studies show it's wise to underpredict - to say operation will take longer that it actually will. 
<br>System can show amount of time as a range. If single value is desitlrable, show the slowest, longest vlaue. In that case expectations are liable to be exceeded, leading to happy result.
<br>61
<br>
<br>People try to find causes for events. If an unexpected event happens after i have taken some action I apt to conclude it was caused by that action, even if theee is no relationship between them.
<br>60
<br>
<br>I try to use an everyday thing, but can't.
<br>People apt to blame themselves, especially when others use it.
<br>Because everybody perceives the fault to be his own, nobody admits having trouble - feelings of guilt and helplessness are hidden.
<br>61
<br>
<br>Failures.
<br>Failures are essential part of creativity and exploration.
<br>If you do not fail you are not trying hard enough. - great creative thoughts will provide breakthroughs how we do things.
<br>It is possible to avoid failure to always be safe - a route to uninteresting life
<br>64
<br>
<br>Design advice:
<br>- eliminate error messages. Instead, provide help and guidance.
<br>- think positively for people you interact with
<br>65
<br>
<br>Inability to use things leads to blamimg yourself and helplessness. That leads to depression
<br>
<br>System error vs Human error
<br>- human errors hard to observe
<br>- people always tend to blame person
<br>- system svould take into account that people err naturally
<br>- same error is likely to be repeated by someone else
<br>66
<br>
<br>Human error = internation, communication error
<br>-
<br>When people collaboeate, word error is never used to describe someines utterance. Because they respond, quescion, clarify.
<br>-
<br>Feedback to understand current state, affordances, signifiers
<br>67
<br>
<br>Feedforward
<br>Give enough information needed for execution
<br>
<br>Procedural knowledge - facts, learned
<br>Best received by practice
<br>Sometimes even best teachers cannot explain what they are doing.
<br>
<br>Security.
<br>Make something too secure, it becomes less secure (password, access policies)
<br>90
<br>
<br>---
<br>Memory.
<br>Learning arbitrary associations (isolated facts - alphabets, names, how to, grocery lists) by providing a structure (artificially).
<br>Mnemonics - improving memory provides standard methods for providing structure.
<br>99
<br>
<br>Peoplewith unable to manufacture some artificial structures (learning methods, developing own) find themselves bad at learning.
<br>99
<br>
<br>Sensible / meaningful structure - when things make sense, helps organize chaos
<br>99
<br>
<br>Design implication: provide meaningful structure (switch lights on steering wheel)
<br>
<br>Practicioners dont need truth. They quickly need results that are good enough for purpose they are applied (converting values
<br>99
<br>
<br>Partnership of tech and people makes us smarter, stronger, better qble to live. Dependence upon tech is old, every decadr covers more activitiew.
<br>113
<br>
<br>Mappings
<br>- best: controls mounted directly on the item controlled (soap dispenser)
<br>- second-best: as close as possible
<br>- third-best: controls are in the same spacial configuration as the object to be controlled.
<br>115
<br>
<br>What is natural depends upon point of view, choice of metaphor = culture.
<br>It is possible to break convention and switch to metaphor, but very expect period of confusion until people adapt to the new system.
<br>122
<br>
<br>----
<br>
<br>Discoverability.
<br>Combining knowledge and constraints (cultural, logical, sematic with physical).
<br>Constraints - Thoughtful use of constraints in design lets people readily determine the proper course of action, even in a novel situation (first time, unknown).
<br>125
<br>
<br>Physical constraints
<br>Physical constraints limit possible operations. Thus, a large peg cannot fit into a small hole.
<br>More effective if easy to see and interpret - what set of actions is restricted before anything is done.
<br>125
<br>
<br>Creative people continually change how we interact with our technologies
<br>The meanings of today may not be the meanings of tomorrow.
<br>- fully automated cars - meaning of red lights at the rear? That the car is breaking? For whom that signal would be? Red lights woupd become meaningless, so would be removed or redefined to indicate some other condition.
<br>130
<br>
<br>- tužkové baterky, ak ich vložíš nesprávne, môžeš poškodiť zariadenie. Navrhni tak, aby nebolo možné spraviť chybu - Čo tak povoliť len jeden spôsob ktorým sa vložia? Alebo vytvoriť mechanizmus, pri ktorom nebude záležať na tom, akým smerom ich vložíš
<br>
<br>Root problem
<br>- kľúče: náročné v stiesnených a zle osvetlených podmienkach. Účelom je, aby prístup k niečomu dostala len osoba, ktorá má oprávnenie.
<br>Vskutočnosti nás kľúče nezaujímajú. Namiesto zdokonaľovania ich sprav irrelevant - wireless or biometric devices.
<br>
<br>Conventions.
<br>Do all those issues matter? (Eating chincken with fingers, kissing on cheek,...)
<br>Yes, they do. Violate them and you are marked as an outsider.
<br>132
<br>
<br>Frequent traveller's situation
<br>The behavior that is appropriate in one place is inappropriate in another, even in situations that appear identical
<br>(Cuptural norms,...how to operate devices,...)
<br>135
<br>
<br>Bad design, hard to use systems - lack of comminication between people
<br>Blaming a person is seldom useful.
<br>Problem is due to the difficulties in coordinating the different professions involved (...in installing light controls, shower)
<br>136
<br>
<br>Long row of light switches vs 2d layout of room placing switches in exact correspondence  to the areas they control.
<br>138
<br>#
<br>
<br>Human Centered Design.
<br>A usable design starts with careful observation of the tasks beingsupported are actually performed (task analysis) followed bydesign process that results in agood fit to the ways the taske get performed.
<br>137
<br>
<br>Activity-centered controls vs device-centered
<br>Actibity centered are always proper way to go (if activities are carefuly selected to match actual requirements) (eg presenting mode, driving mode)
<br>But still provide manual controls - there will always be demand for unexpected settings. Invoking manual settings shouldnt cause the main activity to be cancelled.
<br>141
<br>#
<br>
<br>Changes in conventions.
<br>Change is upsetting for people because they habe to learn a new tool and cost is expensive.
<br>Consistency has to be followed. If a new way is only slightly better than the old, it is better to be consistent. But if there is to be change, everybody has to change. Mixed systems are confusing for everyone.
<br>When a new way is vastly superior to another, then merits of change will outweight difficultyof change. Just because something is different doesnt mean its bad. If we only kept to the old, we could never improve.
<br>150
<br>##
<br>
<br>When no other solution is possible, simple design everything the same way, so people only have to learn once
<br>(Standards simplify life for everyone, at the same time, they tend to hinder future development).
<br>155
<br>#
<br>
<br>Sounds.
<br>- useful role in providing feedback about events, absence - leads to difficulties, lack of feedback
<br>Beeping - artificial, no knowledge about source
<br>Real natural sounds - essential, sound tells you aboutthings you cant see while your eyes are occupied elsewhere
<br>- reflect complex interaction of natural objects: hollow or solid, metal or wood, soft or hard, hard or smooth. Sounds are generated when materials interact, sound tell us whether they are hitting, tearing, sliding, breaking, tearing.
<br>- ok to genearate artificially if: using rich auditory spectrum, with care to provide subtle clues without being annoying
<br>156
<br>
<br>Skeuomorphic 
<br>- incorporating old, familiar ideas into new technologies, even though they play no longer a functional role.
<br>- first cars looked like horse carriages, called horseless carriages (kone pod kapotou), early plastics looked like wood
<br>- way of overcoming fear of new is to make it look like the old.
<br>- makes learning easier - existing conceptual models are modified rather than replaced
<br>- easing transition from old to the new
<br>159
<br>#
<br>
<br>----
<br>Errors
<br>Dont investigate who's responsible, investigate how to prevent them or repeat with minimal impact.
<br>(85percent errors are always thrown on people - unreasonable)
<br>- investigate deeper, even if the reason was found: 5 whys
<br>164
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>When people err, change the system so that type of error will be reduced or eliminated.
<br>When complete elimination is not possible, redesign to reduce impact.
<br>167
<br>##
<br>
<br>If system lets you make an error, its badly designed.
<br>If system induces you to make error, its really badly designed.
<br>- you need to change culture and admit that problems exists.
<br>167
<br>
<br>Why people err:
<br>- we design for requirements of systems and machines, not requirements of people
<br>Machines require precise commands and guifance. People are bad in that
<br>- people are creative: good in creatimg new ways of doing things and seeing opportunities. Bad in repeating
<br>- time stress. Pressure to push ahead with the work. Dont slow down the processes - loss, service quality...We try to do too many tasks at the same time. We drive faster than is safe.
<br>If we do well we are rewarded and praised for heroic efforts. If things go wrong, we are blamed and punished.
<br>169
<br>##
<br>
<br>In many industries, rules are written more a goal toward legal compliance thanwith an understanding work requirements.
<br>169
<br>
<br>Errors:
<br>
<br>Capture Slips
<br>- situation, where instead of desired activity, a more frequently or recently performed gets done instead (counting pages at copying machine: ...8,9,10,J,Q,K)
<br>-Design: avoid procedures that have identical opening steps but then diverge. The more experienced the workers, they more likely human error happens. Whenever possible, sequences shoulfd be designed to differ from very first start.
<br>##
<br>174
<br>
<br>Similarity Slips
<br>- selecting wrong thing because it's similar to intended one
<br>- people have difficulties distuingissghing when they're tired, stressed, overloaded
<br>+
<br>- Design: ensure tgat controls and displays for different purposes are significantly different
<br>Airplane cockpits - controls are shape coded so they look and feel different from one another: throttle levers are different from flap levers (look like a wing flap), which are different from gear control (look like a wheel)
<br>176
<br>##
<br>
<br>Memory-lapse Slips
<br>- forget original document in copy machine
<br>- caused by interruptions or too many steps overloading capacity of short-term or working memory
<br>- Design: minimize number of steps, provide reminders of steps needed to be completed, or forcing functions (remove bank card from atm)
<br>178
<br>##
<br>
<br>Mode Error Slips
<br>- when device has different states (modes) in which same controls have different meaning
<br>- if you separate modes from parameters, operator always needs to be aware of mode. What if get interrupted after selecting mode and before enterimg parameters? Or modes can change?
<br>- Design: errors are likely when modes are not visible. If modes are going to change, notify in advance.
<br>Avoid modes if necessary. Make invoked mode obvious. 
<br>Designers must always compensate for INTERFERING activities.
<br>179
<br>##
<br>
<br>Mistakes.
<br>Come frilom inappropriaye goals or from faulty comparison of the outcome with goal.
<br>179
<br>
<br>We make decisions based on what's in our memory. But retrieval from long term memory is actually a reconstruction rather than an actual record. As a result, it's a subject to numerous biases.
<br>179
<br>
<br>Rule-based mistakes
<br>Once situation is classified, the selection of appropriate rule is often straightforward (driving). What if the classicication of situation is wrong?
<br>
<br>Complexity of real world problems, where the problem is often too much of information, much of it contradictory. Often, decisions must be made quickly.
<br>- designer: provide as much guida ce as possible to ensure current stae of things is displayed in easily interpreted format -- ideally graphical
<br>183
<br>
<br>When you imvestigate something, you already know what happened. Its easire to pick out which information is relevant. Retrospective decision making.
<br>Well during the event nothing may be obvious.
<br>183
<br>#
<br>
<br>Memory based mistakes.
<br>(Interruption leads to) forgetting thr goal, or evaluation of the curremt state of environment. This leads to mistakes because goals may become wrong, or reevaluating and remaking decision can be erroneous.
<br>-
<br>Design: ASSUME that people will be INTERRUPTED during their activities and that they may need assistance in resuming their operations.
<br>186
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>Social pressure
<br>- figures in many accide ts in industry, aviary, personal life (time and economic forces)
<br>- Never underestimate the power of social pressure on behaviour, causing otherwise sensible people to do things ghey know are wrong amd possiblely dangerous.
<br>#
<br>187
<br>
<br>Checklists
<br>- powerful tool to inceease accuracy of behavior and reduce errors
<br>- always better to have two people do checklists together (A reads, B executes) than making one person to complete and second to check
<br>190
<br>
<br>The only way to reduce incidence of errors is to admit their existence, gather information, be able to make chamges to reduce their occurence.
<br>Hospitals, courts, police systems, utility companies - are reluctant to admit that their workers are capable of errors.
<br>Rather than stigmatize those who admit to error, we should make it easier to REPORT ERRORS.
<br>192
<br>#
<br>
<br>No accident appeared to be serious.
<br>People tend to find logical explanation for anomalies which show up as warning signs
<br>- these explanations are based on past experiences, which may not apply to current situation.
<br>- most of the time apparent anomalies should be ignored. But distinguishing true anomaly from apparent is difficult.
<br>196
<br>
<br>Design for errors
<br>- understand causes and design to minimize these causes
<br>- do sensibility checks. Does tge action pass the common sense test?
<br>- make it possible to reverse actions (undo). Irreversible actions should be harder to make.
<br>- make it easier for people to discover and correct errors.
<br>- dont treat actions as errors. Rather, help to complete action properly.
<br>199
<br>#
<br>
<br>Interruption - major cause of errors
<br>Interrution = interruption cost + resume cost (resume previous state of the activity)
<br>+
<br>- discard information stored in short-term memory - what still needs to be done?
<br>200
<br>
<br>Multitasking.
<br>-Degradation of performance: talking while driving leads to serious degradation of driving skills (study: unable to notice unusual activity along the route - a unicycling clown)
<br>
<br>- aviation. Pilots not allowed to discuss any topic unrelated to the control of the plane during takeoff and landing
<br>- practice:dont talk while driving during entering highway, overtaking, crossing intersections
<br>200
<br>
<br>Design of warning signals.
<br>Have to be loud and bright enough to be noticed, not too much that they become annoying distractions.
<br>201
<br>
<br>Design for errors
<br>1. Add constraints to block errors
<br>Shape, colors and size. Prevent adding fluid to wrong container, wrong medication in hospitals
<br>2.Undo
<br>3. Confirmation
<br>Ineffective against mistakes - at requesting comfirmation, people are certain they want to do it. Remind action and object
<br>- make object being acted upon more prominent
<br>- make operation reversible (restore to the latest condition)
<br>#
<br>4. Sensibility checks - prevent inappropriate values to be entered (serious errors in xray or hospitals)
<br>5. Minimize slips - occur when distracted (either by event or we learned action be done automatically, without concious attention)
<br>Prevention: ensure as many actions are as dissimilar as possible.
<br>###
<br>--
<br>6. Make things visible, both for execution and evaluation
<br>###
<br>---
<br>7. Dont require all the knowledge to operate must be in head. Allow effecient operation when people have all required knowledge, but make it oosible for non-experts.
<br>204
<br>
<br>
<br>-----
<br>
<br>Design Thinking
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Rule #1
<br>Never solve the problem you are asked to solve.
<br>- its not a root problem, but a symptom
<br>- People can make stunning analysis on any problem they are given - if you start without questioning, how do you know its a root problem? 
<br>###
<br>217
<br>
<br>A brilliant solution to wrong problem can be worse tgan no solution.
<br>
<br>Good designers never start by tryimg to solve the problem. They study people, what they are trying to accomplish. 
<br>Managers are going crazy. They want to see progress.
<br>Designers seem to be going backward when they are given a precise problem and instead of getting to work they generate new issues to consider, new directions to explore.
<br>Design thinking - dont search for solution until you have determined the real problem
<br>#
<br>219
<br>
<br>Human-centered design
<br>A process of ensuring human needs are met, resulting product understandable abd usable, accomolishes desired task, experience of use is positive and enjoyable.
<br>219
<br>#
<br>
<br>Dentist metalhor - you dont tell dentist what drill to use
<br>
<br>
<br>Double diamond model
<br>Explore and concerge to problem, then explire and converge to solution.
<br>
<br>When designers focus on problem, they dont seem make progress - developing ideas, many only half-formed, many clearly impractical.
<br>Managers are concerned about meeting the schedule, want to see immeduate convergence to solution.
<br>To add more frustratiin, designers may realize they have inappropraluately formulated problem and all process needs to be repeated.
<br>221
<br>
<br>How can mass-products have personal meaning?
<br>- overcome product sameness by allowing customers to customize them
<br>
<br>Some products are also symbols of status and group ownership.
<br>Although they perform useful functions, they are also fashion statement
<br>
<br>Design wants to know what people really need and how they use the product
<br>- qualitative methods
<br>Marketing wants to know what and why they will buy
<br>- quantitatice methods
<br>Different goals, different methods, different results
<br>224 
<br>
<br>Tradeoff - deep insights on real meeds from tiny set of people or broad data from a large group of people. Both are needed.
<br>225
<br>
<br>Numbers can give false impression of users
<br>225
<br>
<br>HCD
<br>- repeat in cycles
<br>1 observation
<br>2 ideation
<br>3 prototyping
<br>4 testing
<br>222
<br>
<br>1. Observation
<br>- dont take shortcuts and stay home, talking to students or random people
<br>
<br>2. Ideation
<br>
<br>Even crazy ideas, often obviously wrong, can contain creative insights that can later be extracted in the final idea selection. Avoid premature dismissal of ideas.
<br>226
<br>#
<br>
<br>Question everything - a stupid question asks about things so fundamental that everyone assumes answer is obvious.
<br>The obvious often is not obvious.
<br>- obvious meabs how things always have been done. Often solution is discovered through questioning the obvious.
<br>226
<br>#
<br>
<br>Failures - encourage by calling Learning experiences
<br>Rational executives: dont understand - determime requirements, build them, test to prove.
<br>If everything works perfectly, only little is learnd. Learn through difficulties
<br>230
<br>
<br>Requirements made by asking people are invariably wrong
<br>Requirements are developed by watching oeople in their natural environment.
<br>-
<br>When people are asked what they need, they think of the everyday oroblems, seldom noticing larger failuers and problems.
<br>They dont question major methods tgey use.
<br>#
<br>230
<br>
<br>Their methods may be different from what they describe.
<br>"Oh, i had to do this differently". It turns out these special cases are significant.
<br>
<br>With each iteration ideas are clearer, specifications better defined.
<br>Several prototype ideas may collapse into one solution.
<br>230
<br>
<br>Activities.
<br>
<br>Focusing upon tasks is too limiting.
<br>#
<br>- apple ipod: brilliant design + support tlfor tye entire activity of music enjoyment (discover, purchase, playlists, listenimg, send music throuout home, listen on ther sound systems)
<br>- 
<br>Well designed products will package together tasks required to support activity, making them work seamlessly with one another, making sure their requirements dont interfere with each other.
<br>#
<br>232
<br>
<br>Activities are hierarchical: high and low level.
<br>
<br>Design for activities (can be used by everyone across the world), 
<br>not for people (doesnt scale)
<br>#
<br>
<br>Market-driven needs and engineering driven company yeld ever-increasing features, complexity and confusion.
<br>How ro search for human needs here?
<br>- we are behind the schedule and over budget. We will do design research next time. Sorry. But you are absolutely right... Same arguments used over and over. There is never next time.
<br>- solution: the clash of disciplines can be resolved by creating multidisciplinary teams: participants learn to understand and respect requirements of each other.
<br>239
<br>
<br>Good designers
<br>- manage interaction of tech and people
<br>- quick learners, for today they may be asked to design a camera, tomirrow transportation system or company's organisational structure. - because fundamental principles of designing for people are same across all domains
<br>
<br>Design for everyone: 
<br>- average lefthander and righthander. What will you get?
<br>- sometimes snot possible to accomodate everyone.
<br>- building a different version of product may be an answer
<br>
