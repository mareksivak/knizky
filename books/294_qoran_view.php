Quran
<br>
<br>Every book has its objective and objective of the Quran is to make man aware of the Creation plan of God. That is, to tell man why God created this world, what the purpose is of settling man on earth, what is required from man  in his pre-death life span and what is he going to confront after death.
<br>x
<br>
<br>When God created man, He divided his life span into two periods, the pre-death period, which is a time of trial, and the post death period, which is the time of receiving rewards or punishment merited by one's actions during one's lifetime

<br>
<br>While reading Quran, we feel that its writer is on a very high pedestal from where He is looking down and addressing the whole humanity, which is His special concern.

<br>
<br>Quran is a book of jihad, and jihad to them is an attempt to achieve one's goal by means of violence. This idea is based on misundersranding.
<br>Anyone who reads the Quran will easily appreciate his message has nothing to do with violence.
<br>Obviously, the Quran is not a weapon, but a book which gives us an introduction to the divine idealogy of peaceful struggle - according to the Quran: to speak to them a word to reach their very soul.

<br>The Gita, the holy book of the Hindus, pertains ti wisdom and moral values. The exhoration to wage war in the Gita applies only to exceptional cases where circumstamces leave no choice.
<br>But for general day-to-day existence it gives the same peaceful commands as derived from it by Mahatma Gandhi.

<br>When the Prophet Muhammad emigrated from Makkah to Madinah, the idolatrous tribes were aggressive towards him. But the prophet always averted their attacks by the excercise of patience and the strategy of avoidance. 
<br>However, in certain occasions no other options existed. Therefore, he had to battle on certain occassions.
<br>These commands, being specific to certain circumstamces had no general application. Permanent status of the Prophet has been termed a "mercy for all mankind".

<br>
<br>2:34 When We said to the angels Bow down before Adam, they all bowed except of Iblis (Satan). He refused and acted proudly and became an unbeliever.
<br>35 We said: O Adam! Live woth your wofe in Paradise and eat freely from it anywhere you may wish. Yet do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers.
<br>36 But Satan caused them both to slip through thos and thus brought about the loss of their former state. We said: Go down from gere as enemies to each other, and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while
<br>
<br>2:50 and when We divided the sea for you  and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people, while you looked on.
<br>51 We appointed for Moses forty nights (on Mount Sinai) and in his absence you took to worshipping the calf, and thus becamr transgressors.
<br>52 Yet after that we parfoned you, so you might be grateful
<br>53 Rember when we gave Moses the Scripture, and the criterion (to distinguisg right and wrong), so that you might be guided
<br>
<br>2:99 whoever is an enemy of God, His angels, or His messengers, or of Gabriel and Michael, will sirely find that God too is the enemy of those who deny truth.
<br>
<br>2:118 Those who are devoid of knowledge say: Why does God not speeak to us or show a sign? The same demand was made by those before them, their hearts are all alike. We made tge signs clear to those whose faith is firm.
<br>
<br>2:127 And when Abraham and Ishmael were laying the foundations of the House, they prayed: Our Lord, accept this from us, for you areall hearing and all knowing.
<br>128 Lord, make us submissive to You, make of our descendants a nation that will submit to You. Teach us our rites of worship and turn to us with mercy, you are tge forgiving One and tge merciful.
<br>
<br>2:142 ...The East and West belong to God...
<br>143 Thus we have made you a middle nation, so that you may act like a witness of mankind, and the messenger may be a witness for you...
<br>
<br>2:172 Believers, eat the wholese things which We have provided for you and give thanks to God, if it is Him you worship.
<br>173 He has forbiddenyou only carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine, also any flesh that is cinsecrated other than in the name of God. But for one who is driven by necessity, neither craving or transgressing, it is no sin. For God is forgiving and merciful.

<br>
<br>2:183 Believers, fasting has been perscribed for you, just asit was perscribed to those before you, so that ypu may guard yourself against evil.

<br>185 The month of Ramadan is the month when the Quran was sent down asa guidance for mankind with clear proofs of guidance and the criterion to distinguish right from wrong. Therefore, whoever is present in tgat month, let him fast, but he who is ill or is on a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on. He desires you to fast the whole month so that you may glorify Him for His having guided you and so that you may be grateful to Him. 
<br>
<br>2:187 It has been made lawful  for youto go to your wifes on the night of the fast. God is aware that you were deceiving yourselves and he hasturned his mercy towards you and pardoned you...Eat and drink untilthe white thread of dawn becomes distinct from black. Then resume the fast until nightfall...

<br>
<br>2:213 Mankind was once a single community, (but then people developed in differences), so God sent his prophets to them as bearers of good thingsand warning...
<br>
<br>2:216 ... You may dislike something although it is good for you, or like something although it is bad for you. God knows but you don't.
<br>
<br>2:222 They ask you abou menstruation. Say: It is an impurity, so keep away from women during it and do not approach them until they are cleansed...God loves those who keep themselves clean
<br>
<br>2:253 ... We gave Jesus, the som of Mary clear signs, and stregthened him with the holly spirit. Had God pleased, those who succeededthem would not have fought against one another after the clear signs had come to them. But they disagreed among themselves, some believed while others did not....

<br>
<br>5:51 Believers, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies. They are allies with one another. Whoever of you takes them as an ally shall become one of them. God does not guide the wrongdoers.
<br>
<br>5:73 They are deniers of truth who say: God is one of three. There is only one God. If they do not desist from so saying, a painful punishment is bound to befall such of them as they are bent on denying the truth.
<br>
<br>5:75 Christ, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Many messengers passed away before him. His mother was a virtuous woman and they both ate food. See how we make signs clear to them! See how they turn away!
<br>5:76 Say: Do you worship something other than God, that has no power to do you harm or good? God alone is the All Hearing and All Knowing.

<br>
<br>11:46 God said: Noah, he was not one of your family. For, indeed, he was umrighteous in his conduct. Do not question me about something you have no knowledge, I adonish youlest you become an ignorant man.
<br>47 He said: My Lord, I take refuge with you from asking You something of which I have no knowlwdge. If you do not forgive me and show no mercy, I shall be one of the losers.
<br>
<br>12:23 ... Wrongdoers certainly never prosper.

<br>

<br>in case Solomon and his hostsinadvertently crush you.
