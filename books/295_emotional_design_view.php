<br>Visceral design - has to do with appearances
<br>Behavioral - pleasure and effectiveness to use
<br>Reflective - considers rationalization and intellectualization of a product
<br>
<br>Some products evoke strong emotions such as love, happiness, and attachments.
<br>These can overlook from difficulties to use
<br>"The teapot is so pretty it makes me smile, it's the first thing in the morning. So what ifits a little difficult to use? Just be careful."
<br>
<br>Utility and usability are important, but without emotions our life would be incomplete.
<br>Emotions: aesthetics, attractiveness, beauty.
<br>
<br>Usable designs are not necessarily enjoyable to use.
<br>Attractive design is not necessarily the most effecient.
<br>
<br>Aesthetically pleasing products enable you to work better
<br>- when you wash your car, doesnt it seem to drive better?
<br>- when you bath and dress up in new facy clothes, dont you feel better?
<br>
<br>ATMs, all performed same functions, but some have buttons and screens arranged attractively, some not. In 90s Japanese researchers found out attractive ones are perceived to be easier to use.
<br>
<br>Until recently, emotions were underexplored part of human psychology.
<br>Some people thought its an evolutionary leftover.
<br>Some thought of emotions as a problem to be overcome by rational thinking.
<br>Science knows that evolutionarily more advanced animals are more emotional than primitive ones and humans are the most emotional of all.
<br>Emotions: asses situations as good or bad, safe or dangerous. Positive emotions are as important as negative ones
<br>
<br>Alice Insen (psychologist) Research
<br>- being happy broadens thought processes and fascilitates creative thinking
<br>- people asked to solve difficult problems (out of the box thinking) did much better if they were given a small gift ( big enough to feel good)
<br>- Anxious people narrow down their thought processes, concentrating upon aspects directly relevant to the problem (useful strategy in escaping from danger)
<br>- conclusion: happy people are more effective in finding effective solutions and more tolerant to minor difficulties
<br>- Design: attractive products make people feel good, creative. Make it easier for people to find solutions to their problems. If first thing you try fails to produce desired result, you try it again with more effort
<br>#
<br>
<br>With positive affect you prefer to concentrate on bigger picture rather than small details.
<br>When you are sad on anxious, feeling negative affect, you are more likely to see the trees than the forest.
<br>- Design: in pleasa t mood, overlook minor problems with device. When people are anxious, they are more focused, designer must pay special attention ti ensure that all the information required to do the task is continually at hand, visible and with clear and unambiguous feedback.
<br>/ Things intended to be used in stressful situation require a lot more care with more attention to detail
<br>#
<br>
<br>Design for stressful situatiom
<br>- designer needs to feel in good mood, reqired to creative thinking and concentration
<br>- brainstorming sessions: warm up by jokes or playing games. No criticism - raise anxiety
<br>- transforming ideas to products: focus through deadlines slightly shorter than comfortable

<br>3 Levels of Processing
<br>
<br>Visceral Level
<br>Has no reasoning. People programmed for:
<br>- warm places
<br>- sweet tastes
<br>- bright, highly saturated hues
<br>- melodies, rhythms, harmonious music and sound, rhytmic beats
<br>- attractive people
<br>- symmettical, rounded, smooth objects
<br>----
<br>Negative effect:
<br>- height
<br>- sudden, unexpected bright lights, loud, harsh sounds
<br>- extreme hot or cold
<br>- darkness
<br>- empty, flat terrain (desert)
<br>- crowded, dense terrain (jungle, forestz)
<br>- crowds of people
<br>- rotting smells, decaying food, vomit
<br>- sharp objects
<br>- bitter taste
<br>
<br>Our reflective level can overcome disputes from visceral, pure biological level (advantage over other animals)
<br>
<br>Children cannot speak any language, buttheir brain is prepared to learn. Learning is automatic.
<br>
<br>Personality.
<br>A collection of changable traits a person has over life time
<br>We all have different personalities emphasizing different traits with family or friends.
<br>
<br>Design: what is appealing at one moment may not be at another one.
<br>Same phenomenon appears in all aspects of life: watching movies, interactions with people, walk in forest.
<br>
<br>Reflective and Behavioral
<br>Teenage culture dislikes things solely because adult culture likes them.
<br>
<br>Design: think of challenges as opportunities. Never stop exploring.
<br>
<br>A person interprets an experience at many levels, but what appeals at one, may not at another (nice looking tools, bad memories from using)
<br>Successful design has to excel at all.
<br>
<br>1. Visceral: pre-cosncious, pre-thought - appearance matters, first impressions are formed. Initial impact through appearance, touch, feel
<br>
<br>2. Reflective: about use. Functionality, performance, usability (pleasure and effectiveness
<br>
<br>3. Behavioral: highest level of emotion, feeling, consciousness. Interpretation, understanding, reasoning
<br>
<br>###
<br>
<br>Whats appropriate fpr one setting may not be for another (this could hurt ses of Apple Macintosh, colorful computer inaproppriate for the wprld of serious business)
<br>
<br>Needs vs Wants
<br>- Needs - determined by task (person's activiies)
<br>- Wants - determinef by culture, advertising, how someone sees himself (self-image)
<br>
<br>West placing more emphasos on individual, East on the group.
<br>Americams tent to want to excel as individuals, whereas Japansese wish to be good members of their groups and contributors.
<br>
<br>1950s cake mix was introduced. Just add water and ready to bake. Failed - no feeling of accompliahment, too easy.
<br>Changed to: add egg and mix - gave the act of baking feeling accomplishment 
<br>- problem had nothing with product's value but emotional connection that links product to the user. Its all about emotion - pride, feeling of accomplishment.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Personality.
<br>Fashion - accords and conventions adopted by society at the time.
<br>When too many people like something it is no longer deemed as appropriate by leaders of society to partake.
<br>- How can one be leader by doing today what others will be doing tomorrow?
<br>- Even the rebelious have to change continually, carefully noticing what is in the fashion and what not, carefully creating their own fashion of counterfashion
<br>#
<br>
<br>Dealing with popular taste.
<br>If product is something fundamental to life, the proper response is to ignore continual shifts in popular semtiment and focus on long lasting value.
<br>- must be attractibe, pleasurable and fun, but also effective, understandable and appropriately priced.
<br>- in the long run, simple style with quality construction amd effective performance wins. Stick to these fundamentals.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Make design appropriate to different marekt segment (game consoles for gaming and education. Informal for gaming, polite for cooking).
<br>- probably mecesaary to have multiple versions for different market segments
<br>- probably necessary to do rapid changes as market dictates.
<br>
<br>Designing for fashion is tricky. Some see it as challenge, some as opportunity.
<br>Keeping up with changes - opportunity
<br>
<br>tldr
<br>Attractive things do work better. Produce positive emotions, make people creative and tolerant to minor issues.
<br>
<br>----
<br>3 levels of processing
<br>
<br>Cost - part of attraction, where reflective part says: it's expensive, it must be special.
<br>
<br>1. VISCERAL
<br>
<br>Plants change to attrqct animals (colors, sweet fruits), and animals change so to be attracted by plants. The human love of sweet tastes and of bright, highly saturated colors derives from this mutual coevolution.
<br>
<br>Designers find "pretty" as lack of depth and substance. They alwant to overcome viaceral level of attraction. They want to be recognized as imaginative, creative and deep and making something pretty, fun, or cute is not accepted. But there is place in our life for such things even if they are simple.
<br>
<br>Toys, clothes, furniture - reflecing visceral level - bright, highly saturated primary colors
<br>
<br>Bitter - disliked, poisons taste bitter
<br>
<br>Acquired taste - things visceraly negative, reflectively positive. Learnt to overcome natural inclination to dislike (crowded noisy spaces, non harmonic music, beats)
<br>
<br>Principles underlaying visceral design are consistent across cultures - if you design according to these rules, your design will be always attractive, even if somewhat simple.
<br>#
<br>
<br>If you design for sophosticated, your design will become dated, because reflective layer is sensitive to cultures, trends and fluctuations.
<br>Today's sophostication runs the risk of becoming tomorrow's discard.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Visceral
<br>- look, feel, sound dominate
<br>- master chef concentratesbon presentation, artfully arranging food on plate
<br>- good graphics, cleanliness, sound play role (closing car doors, pleasant chunking sound, motorcycle - unique, powerful rumbling sound, car - sleek, elegant, exciting) 
<br>- physical feel and texture of materials matters
<br>- sensuality and sexuality play roles (shower streaming water across your body, fresh appetizing closed views on food
<br>- we love sensuous curves, sleek surfaces, solif sturdy objects
<br>- market research: measure reactions (I want it)
<br>##
<br>
<br>Apple iMac - same hardware, sales boomed. VW Beetle 1993, Audi TT - sales boomed
<br>
<br>2. BEHAVIORAL
<br>
<br>About use - finction, usability, understanability, physical feel.
<br>Appearance doesnt matter
<br>
<br>Function first - whAt doss it do?
<br>If it doesnt do its function well, who cares how well it looks?
<br>If watch dossnt tell exact time, potato peeler doesnt peel potatoes.
<br>Some well designed products miss their target in terms of purpose and fail.
<br>#
<br>
<br>If product category exists, you can observe improvements. What if not? Thats how breakthroughs come from.
<br>
<br>Study what patterns of activites do users perform. Tasks nd activotoes are not supported well by individual features.
<br>They require attention to a sequence of actions - true needs.
<br>Understand how people will use the product. Start with basic observations if you havent.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Product development
<br>1. Enhancement - improve what exists
<br>2. Innovation - create what was impossible to make before
<br>
<br>
<br>Innovation 
<br>- impossible to predict popularity, however, may seem obvious afterward
<br>- cannot be evaluated  by asking potential users on their views - have no experience with - answers are notoriously bad.
<br>What they said they would like failed in marketplace.
<br>What they were not interested in, succeeded
<br>- cell phones. Intended for business people. No one could imagine carrying them. However, they did and explained: for case of emergency.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Enhancement
<br>Function.
<br>People find it difficult to talk about their problems. They dont think of them as design flaws
<br>- inserting usb keys, unlocking car to close opened windows, struggling with a key. All bad design issues. You'd probably blamed yourself. All can be improved by appropriate design
<br>- symmetrical keys, closing windows outside of car, drink holders
<br>- requires clever observations, all solutions already exist
<br>- sometimes it doesnt bring success - but shows attention to true customer needs that signify quality products
<br>#
<br>
<br>Observation of needs
<br>- people are unaware of their needs. Their discovery requires careful observation in their natural environments
<br>
<br>Understanding.
<br>- learn one, use forever. Instead of memorizing operation steps
<br>- no understanding: do t know what to do when things go wrong
<br>- NEGATIVE emotions kick in when there's lack of understanding - feel frustrated and out of control
<br>#
<br>
<br>3 different mental images of any object:
<br>1. Designers model - how dsigner sees product
<br>2. Users model
<br>3. System image - how its communicated, needs to comvey proper user model
<br>In ideal world, should be identical. Because designers dont talk to users, only specify - people form their models from observations- appearance, how it works, feedback it gives
<br>Failures - self- centrism: engineers focus on tech, designers on their images and metaphors, that win prices, but are inaccessible to users. Ignoring concerns of users who use it to satisfy some need.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Good designers worry a lot about physical appearamce of their products.
<br>Physical touch a d feel can create a huge difference in appreciation of products (Critical for design)
<br>Consider delights of smooth metal or soft leather
<br>#
<br>
<br>- imagine hi-quality knife, the sound of cutting on the chopping board
<br>- sizzle when you drop food into skillet
<br>- odors released from fresh-cut food
<br>- touch, vibration, smell, sound, feel, physical appearance
<br>
<br>Good behavioral design - human-centered
<br>- focused on needs, solving problems
<br>- discover through observation, when product is used naturally
<br>#
<br>
<br>Interviews, surveys,... - poor tools for learning about behavior - divorced from actual use
<br>
<br>REFLECTIVE
<br>Reflecyive processing - when you make statements about yourself and things you care about - Refraining from purchasing someone, supporting causes, worrying about appearance
<br>
<br>Swatch - a concept that a piece of advanced technology is a vehicle for emotions, not functions
<br>
<br>Products can be more than sum of functions. 
<br>Real value in fulfilling emotional needs, especially establishing one's self-image and place in the world.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Paintings are not about aesthetics. Then a good reproduction should suffice.
<br>Tbey are about reflective value of owning or viewing the original.
<br>
<br>Visceral:
<br>Attractiveness: response to appearance
<br>Reflextive:
<br>- BEAUTY: looks below surface, comes from concious reflection and experience
<br>- prestige
<br>- exclusivity, customer relationship (good relationship can reverse negative experience)
<br>#
<br>- all about long lasting customer experience, service, personal touch, warm interaction
<br>
<br>Headsets.
<br>- create a cool look for product that is overlooked as background item
<br>- turn it into image-building product that attracts attention
<br>- not only function well; effective advertising tool
<br>- reflective: build self-image. Show as disciplined leader managing worlds thoughest players whonwere always in control. Visceral: look masculine.
<br>
<br>If people dont know what they whant, how to satisfy their needs?
<br>Human centered design: provide tools for exploration and discovery, empower to success
<br>
<br>If you wear a 1000 dollar suit, you exude confident. People see you confident and you act confident
<br>
<br>Rearranging items in stores.
<br>Perverse usability set: make it difficult to buy popular/desired items and extremely easy to buy impulsive items 
<br>#
<br>- critical that customer wont notoce they are manipulated when these tricks are used. Make store layour appear normal. Make disorientation part of fun - wandering through store ispart of the experience (works well in fashion). When do correctly (Science of Shopping, Paco Underhill), experiemce can be positive emotional one for shopper and profitable for seller.
<br>
<br>Arts - when something is clearly understanable, its judged as flawed, uninterpretable - necessity of good
<br>
<br>Behavioral design - continuous reiteration and testing
<br>-
<br>Viaceral and reflective - iterative method is design by compromise, by comittee, guarantees safe and effective result, but invariably dull
<br>- usually such designs are driveb by vision of ONE PERSON (movies, advertising)
<br>#
<br>
<br>Testing movie scenes, cutting off for popularity. Directors - killing the soul of movie. Both valid
<br>- choose: either artist making a statement or or business person, making film appeal even at cost of artistic merit
<br>
<br>Komar, Melamid: conducted surveys on artistic preferences. Then produced exhibitions to perfectly user centered art.
<br>Results: - lack of innovation and craftmanship, disliked even by responders.
<br>Perfectly user centered design would be disturbing as well, as it would lack artistry.
<br>- if you want a successful product, test a revise
<br>- if you wamt a great product that changes the world, let it be driven by someone woth a clear vision. More risk, only path to greatness
<br>#
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Design for fun and pleasure
<br>
<br>
<br>Presemting information woth numbers. Most of tge time we domt need numbers, we need to see the trenf (up,l, down, fast, slow) and roughly estimate value.
<br>
<br>Where most products fail - in maintaining relationship after initial burst of enthusiasm.
<br>
<br>1. Appearance diverting attention
<br>2. Goes beyond obvious needs and expectations
<br>3. Create an instinctive response on the first sight
<br>4. Espouses values or connections to personal goals
<br>- turns act of juicing into a special experience. Innovation, originality, elegance -> create desire to possess
<br>5. Promises to fulfill these goals
<br>- make an ordinary action extraordinary
<br>- promises to raise status of the owner (to sophistication) for recognizing its qualities
<br>6. Teaches ordinary things can be extraordinary
<br>
<br>Humans are predisposed to antrophomorphise - to project human emotions and beliefs into anythibg
<br>- positive responses if product works smoothly, design is elegant and fun
<br>- 5 cues: physical (eyes, body), psychological (empathy, feelings, personality, humor), language (spoken language), social dynamics (praise for good work, reciprocity), social roles (teacher, doctor, teammate)
<br>- praise or blame a tennis rocket if you win or lose
<br>
<br>Trust and Design.
<br>- It means one can count upon prpductbto perform according to expectation.
<br>- expectations set by advertisements and recommendations
<br>
<br>The more people involved, the safety will decrease.
<br>- bystander apathy - many witnesses watching murder, no one helped
<br>- standing in crowd: if it was really serious, someone else would have already helped. No extra care for the task
<br>
<br>Instant messaging - whole point is not information sharing but emotional connection
<br>
<br>Lie detectors - unreliable because tyey detect emotional responses rather than lies.
<br>
<br>If frustration is due to ambiguity and lacknof information - need to clarify.
<br>If furstration is due to the complexity of problem - do nothing.
<br>Its normal to get frustrated from problem which is slightly beyond ability. 
<br>If domt get fruatrated occasionaly - not taking enough risks, not pushing yoirself enough.
<br>
