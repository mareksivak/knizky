<br>Happiness - individually crafted. No recipe exists, but tyere are principles.
<br>
<br>People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy.
<br>
<br>“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself"
<br>Viktor Frankl
<br>#
<br>
<br>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen.
<br>#
<br>- child: breaking own record
<br>- violinist: mastering a passage
<br>
<br>Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life.
<br>
<br>What would really satisfy people is not getting slim or rich, but feeling good about their lives.
<br>-happiness: partial solutions dont work
<br>
<br>A person who has achieved control over psychic energy and has invested it in consciously chosen goals cannot help but grow into a more complex being. By stretching skills, by reaching toward higher challenges, such a person becomes an increasingly extraordinary individual.
<br>
<br>As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”
<br>
<br>For the majority of people on this earth, life goals are simple: to survive, to leave children who will in turn survive, and, if possible, to do so with a certain amount of comfort and dignity.
<br>As long as basic needs for survival are solved, having enough food and shelter, new needs are felt - rising expectations - power, wealth, comfort.
<br>
<br>In threadmill of rising expectations, many individuals found way to escape it - regardless of their material conditions, have been able to improve the quality of their lives, who are satisfied,.
<br>Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in CONTROL of their lives.
<br>
<br>When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.
<br>- great civilisations At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback - Romans: confidence after centuries of ruling Mediterranean, Chinese - feeling superior until Mongols, Aztects until Spanish
<br>-
<br>Unwaranted sense of security sooner or later results in rude awakening
<br>#
<br>
<br>During the years of early adulthood the future still looks promising, the hope remains that one’s goals will be realized. But inevitably the bathroom mirror shows the first white hairs,...
<br>When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?”
<br>
<br>some will just surrender and retire gracefully into relative oblivion. Following Candide’s advice, they will give up on the world and cultivate their little gardens. They might dabble in genteel forms of escape such as developing a harmless hobby
<br>
<br>If values and institutions no longer provide as supportive a framework as they once did, each person must use whatever tools are available to carve out a meaningful, enjoyable life.
<br>
<br>To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.
<br>-
<br>Requires a discipline and perseverance
<br>##
<br>
<br>The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment.
<br>-
<br>If a person learns to enjoy and find meaning in the ongoing stream of experience, in the process of living itself, the burden of social controls automatically falls from one’s shoulders. Power returns to the person when rewards are no longer relegated to outside forces.
<br>
<br>People have known for thousands of years what it takes to become free and in control of one’s life, why haven’t we made more progress in this direction?
<br>- like any kind Re f expertise it needs to be learnt, earmed by trial and error by each individual, generation after generation.
<br>- CONTROL over CONCIOUSNESS is not a cognitive skill
<br>
<br>Control over conciousness cannot be instituniolized
<br>Marx - liberation from economic tyranny turned into syystem of opression
<br>Dostoyensky - , if Christ had returned to preach his message of liberation in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name.
<br>
<br>We all know individuals who can transform hopeless situations into challenges to be overcome, just through the force of their personalities. 
<br>#
<br>
<br>This ability to persevere despite obstacles and setbacks is the quality people most admire in others, and justly so; it is probably the most important trait not only for succeeding in life, but for enjoying it as well.
<br>
<br>Being a specialist, he cannot afford the time or the mental energy to do anything other than fine-tune his skill
<br>
<br>ATTENTION
<br>
<br>
<br>While we are thinking about a problem we cannot truly experience either happiness or sadness. 
<br>We cannot run, sing, and balance the checkbook simultaneously, because each one of these activities exhausts most of our capacity for attention.
<br>
<br>Short term memory
<br>It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information
<br>#
<br>
<br>because it is moving very slowly, or because of its unusual appearance. The image of the unusual car enters the focus of consciousness, and we become aware of it.
<br>
<br>As soon as the event is matched to an already known class of events, it is identified. Now it must be evaluated: Is this something to worry about? If the answer is yes, then we must decide on an appropriate course of action: Should we speed up, slow down, change lanes
<br>
<br>there is a distinct process that makes such reactions possible, a process called attention. It is attention that selects the relevant bits of information from the potential millions of bits available.
<br>
<br>Retrieving information from memory storage and bringing it into the focus of awareness, comparing information, evaluating, deciding—all make demands on the mind’s limited processing capacity
<br>
<br>The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.

<br>E.
<br>Not one minute of her life is wasted.
<br>"Very little of her time is spemt on routine functions of her life"
<br>Miving among several residences around world, travels constantly
<br>Usually she is writing, solving problems, reading
<br>While she is at the meeting, her chauffeur instead of waiting will be expected to visit local art gallery or museum, for on her way home she will want to discuss what he thought of its paintings
<br>Ea h day she devotes some time to recharging her mind - facing the lakeshore for 15 mins, facing the sun with eyes closefld, or taking hounds for walk
<br>Poverty, health - she recovered from everything by disciplininv her attention and refusing to difuse ot from unproductive thoughts and activities.
<br>She radiates pure glow of energy
<br>
<br>R.
<br>Although he is known to only a few, his reputation among them is very great.
<br>-
<br>As he talks, his eyes take in everything; every sentence he hears is analyzed three or four different ways even before the speaker has finished saying it.
<br>-
<br>R. gives the impression of restfulness, of calm serenity.
<br>-
<br>But R. does not notice things in order to change them or judge them. He is content to register reality, to understand, and then, perhaps, to express his understanding
<br>
<br>Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We create ourselves by how we invest this energy. Memories, thoughts, and feelings are all shaped by how we use it.
<br>
<br>A musician structures her attention so as to focus on nuances of sound that ordinary people are not aware of, a stockbroker focuses on tiny changes in the market that others do not register
<br>
<br>Sam had no clearly differentiated goals; he wanted exactly what other boys his age are supposed to want,because of what the social environment told them to - he thought vaguely of going to college, then later finding some kind of well-paying job, getting married, and living somewhere in the suburbs. In Bermuda, Sam’s father took him on an excursion to a coral barrier, and they dove underwater to explore the reef. Sam couldn’t believe his eyes. He found the mysterious, beautifully dangerous environment so enchanting that he decided to become more familiar with it. He ended up taking a number of biology courses in high school, and is now in the process of becoming a marine scientist.
<br>
<br>psychic disorder— information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out.
<br>Pain, fear, jealousy
<br>Psychic energy becomes unwieldy and ineffective.
<br>
<br>even the usually boring routines of work become purposeful and enjoyable.
<br>- assembly line worker - beating his record like an athlete
<br>- lawyer - deeply focused on working on complex cases
<br>- quality of life improves if wlyoure able to organize your conciousness as so experience flows.
<br>#
<br>
<br>“It’s exhilarating to come closer and closer to self-discipline. You make your body go and everything hurts; then you look back in awe at the self, at what you’ve done, it just blows your mind. It leads to ecstasy, to self-fulfillment
<br>
<br>If you are not in control of your conciousness, old fears and desires will return soon.
<br>Even buying an island and surrounding with armed bodyguards will not make you feel secured.
<br>
<br>Wealth, status, power - symbols of happines in our culture.
<br>Rich, famous and good-looking people are seen as famous, although all evidence is showing misery.
<br>These symbols dont make us happier - instead they distract from REALITY they are supposed to represent - quality of life depends how we feel of ourselves.
<br>To improve life one must improve quality of experience
<br>###
<br>
<br>Not saying they are irrelevant to happiness - blesaings if they help us feel better.
<br>(Eg money can increase happines, depending how it is used)
<br>
<br>Instead of thinking how to make a million or win people and influence people think how to make every day satisfying.
<br>
<br>ENJOYMENT
<br>
<br>invest psychic energy in goals that are new, that are relatively challenging. 
<br>- children: trying out new movements, new words daily. The rapt concentration on the child’s face as she learns each new skill is a good indication of what enjoyment is about. And each instance of enjoyable learning adds to the complexity of the child’s developing self.
<br>
<br>Without enjoyment life can still be pleasant - depending on luck and external conditions.
<br>- to gain control over life, learn how to build enjoyment
<br>#
<br>
<br>1. Challlenging activity that requires skills
<br>
<br>Ability to manipulate symbolic information is a skill.
<br>Reading - translate words into images, recognize contexts, emphatize with characters, anticipate turns of plot
<br>Maths - shape quamtitati e relationships in head
<br>
<br>Game
<br>- keep difficulty of game constant to skills/condition of player (if he's tired - dog running in tighter circles making easier to catch)
<br>- by bancing experience and skills the game would yeld maximum of enjoyment for all players
<br>
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>FLOW
<br>Concentrated deeply focused experience
<br>
<br>- goals are usually clear, feedback immediate (why to build focus). At any moment always know what to do, immediataly know you did well or bad
<br>##
<br>
<br>Trivial goal doesnt provide enjoyment.
<br>
<br>In creative activities, when goals cannot be set in advance, person needs to develop a sense of what he intends to.
<br>- The artist might not have a visual image of what the finished painting should look like, but when the picture has progressed to a certain point, she should know whether this is what she wanted to achieve or not.
<br>
<br>The concentration of the flow experience—together with clear goals and immediate feedback—provides order to consciousness, inducing the enjoyable condition of psychic negentropy.
<br>

<br>- Distraction from real world problems
<br>- Addiction
<br>- Makes life rich and meaningful
<br>
<br>In flow a person is challenged to do her best, and must constantly improve her skills. 
<br>-
<br>At the time, she doesn’t have the opportunity to reflect on what this means in terms of the self—if she did allow herself to become self-conscious, the experience could not have been very deep. But afterward, when the activity is over and self-consciousness has a chance to resume, the self that the person reflects upon is not the same self that existed before the flow experience: it is now enriched by new skills and fresh achievements.
<br>
<br>Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make.
<br># 
<br>-
<br>But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person’s skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.
<br>
<br>Standardisation.
<br>Major breakthrough in usability
<br>A type of cultural constraint - once you have learnt to drive a car, you can drive any car anywhere in the world 
<br>- standards are good - they simolify our lives and make it possible for different equipments to work in harmony.
<br>
<br>Complexity
<br>- complex things are no longer complicated once tgey are understood
<br>- complexity is good, confusion is bad
<br>- our tools must match pur tasks. The designer's skills come to play to avoid confusion - provide a good conceptual model - people who use kitchen know where each item is stored - there is a structure to apparent randomless (even a reason like il"it was too big, i didnt know where else to put it" is enough to give a structure)
<br>#
<br>
<br>We ended up with crazy agreement that recognized...
<br>
<br>Expanding consciousness
<br>- by drugs, alcohol, hallucinogenic chemicals
<br>- Our ancestors, as they danced wearing the masks of their gods, felt a sense of powerful identification with the forces that ruled the universe. By dressing like a deer, the Yaqui Indian dancer felt at one with the spirit of the animal he impersonated
<br>- A little Girl playing with doll, a boy pretending to be a cowboy - stretching limits of ordinary experience
<br>+
<br>- sense of discovery, creating a new reality, pushes the person to higher performance, leads to previously undreamed of states of consciousness.
<br>Growth by transforming self and making it more complex.
<br>
<br>One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. We grow either bored or frustrated; and then the desire to enjoy ourselves again pushes us to stretch our skills, or to discover new opportunities for using them.
<br>
<br>Overconcentration: another extreme, prevents from enjoying self, focus too tight.
<br>Flow, happiness are not determined by wealth or climate, environment
<br>Opportunties dont automatically bring the enjoyment.
<br>
<br>Obstacles
<br>Anomie - anxiety - not clear what to do. Not clear what is right or not, collapses, economic depressions
<br>Alienation - boredom - whalen system prevents doing something (socialism, solving survival needs,...)
<br>
<br>While paying attention ordinarily involves an additional burden of information processing above the usual baseline effort, for people who have learned to control consciousness focusing attention is relatively effortless, because they can shut off all mental processes but the relevant ones. It is this flexibility of attention.
<br>
<br>Family context to provide optimal experience
<br>1. Clarity: to know what parents expect, unambigous goals
<br>2 Centering: parents interested in rheir present, rather than preoccupied by future, education and career
<br>3. Choice - feel they have options from parents to choose from, including forbidden ones if they are ready to face consequences
<br>4. Commitment - child feels supported to involve in whatever interest
<br>5. Challenge - providimg complex opportunities for action
<br>#
<br>
<br>Tldr: fascilitate clarity of goals, feedback, feeling of co trol, concemtration on tasks, motivation and challenge:
<br>- better chance for kids to order their lives, make flow possible
<br>- children are happier with parents
<br>- likely to obtain more pleasure from life

<br>Blueprint of flow
<br>- to enjoy situations ordinary people would find unbearable - lost in Antartica, prison cell
<br>- transforming harrowable conditions into managable and even enjoyable experience
<br>- when adversity threatens to paralyse you, find a new direction to invest physical energy that lies outside of extrlernal forces
<br>- when aspiration is frustrated, still look fir meaningful goal to organize the self
<br>+
<br>1. Pay close attention to the minute details of environment
<br>- discover its opportunities into actions
<br>2. Set goals and monitor feedback
<br>- keep raising the bar by setting increasingly complex challenges
<br>++ Concentration camp prisoner, hostages, political prisoners: 
<br>Eva Zeisel, a ceramic designer prisoned by communists: kept sanity by making bra from materials she had, holdong imaginary conversations in French, doing gymnastics, memorising poems she composed
<br>- Solzhenitsin's coprisoner: drew a map of the world on the floor, imagined himself travelling across continets, making a few km per day
<br>- Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, sustained himself by similar game: pretending taking a walking trip to Jerusalem in which his imagination provided all events along the way
<br>- US POV in Vietnam: imprisoned for years, bad health, but strong mind. after rescue asked when he can play golf. He intemsively imagined himself practising playing golf. Preserved his sanity and physical skills
<br>- Solzhenitsyn: when standing in a column of prisoners, guards with machine guns shouting, I felt such a rush of rhymes and images. I was both free and happy. There was no barbed wire for me.

<br>
<br>They observed enough opportunities to take actions. Narcistic individuals concerned with protecting self, fall appart when external comdotio s turn threatening
<br>
<br>Without interest in the world, a desire to be actively related into it, you become isolated into yourself.
<br>- to achieve personal happiness, avoid cemtering your attention to external objects / practice these skills and build discipline
<br>

<br>
<br>the easiest step toward improving the quality of life consists in simply learning to control the body and its senses.
<br>
<br>To make sth enjoyable: / turn sth intp form of art
<br>- set gol
<br>- measure
<br>- comcentrate
<br>- develop necessary skils
<br>- raise stakes if activity becomes boring
<br>
<br>Sex
<br>It is impossible for partners not to grow bored unless they work to discover new challenges in each other’s company, and learn appropriate skills for enriching the relationship.
<br>- remains enjoyable if we are willing to control it - find ways to make it complex and cultivate
<br>- invest attention in each other - what dreams and feelings reasides in minds, a never ending process
<br>- same for any mutual activities - travelling, raising children - all plans become more enjoyable and meaningful afyer getting really well to know each other
<br>
<br>Yoga
<br>first one learns to keep things out of the mind, then one learns to keep them in. Intense meditation, or dhyana, is the next step. Here one learns to forget the self in uninterrupted concentration that no longer needs the external stimuli of the preceding phase. Finally the yogin may achieve samadhi, the last stage of “self-collectedness,” when the meditator and the object of meditation become as one - the most joyful experience in their lives.

<br>
<br>(How to:) Experiencing Flow: Senses
<br>
<br>When you encounter a very great work of art, you just know it and it thrills you in all your senses, not just visually, but sensually and intellectually.
<br>
<br>for the trained eye, even the most mundane sights can be delightful.
<br>- marvelous old buildings, some of which are totally ruined, and, I mean, just the fascination of the thing, the curiosity of it…. I can come in and say, “Coming to work this morning was like coming through a Sheeler precisionist painting.”
<br>
<br>The next level of challenge music presents is the analogic mode of listening. In this stage, one develops the skill to evoke feelings and images based on the patterns of sound.
<br>
<br>too much emphasis is placed on how they perform, and too little on what they experience. Parents who push their children to excel at the violin are generally not interested in whether the children are actually enjoying the playing;
<br>- parental expectations create stress, disorder sometimes breakdown
<br>
<br>Although playing an instrument is best learned when young, it is really never too late to start.
<br>many a successful businessman decides to learn the piano after age fifty
<br>Learning to produce harmonious sounds is not only enjoyable, but like the mastery of any complex skill, it also helps strengthen the self.
<br>
<br>Athletes know well that to improve performance beyond a certain point they must learn to discipline their minds.
<br>
<br>To enjoy mental activity, meet the same conditions as for physical ones: skill im domaim needed, have rules, goal, and feedback
<br>#
<br>
<br>The social roles culture prescribes then take care of shaping our minds for us, and we generally place ourselves on automatic pilot till the end of the day, when it is time again to lose consciousness in sleep.
<br>
<br>Prečo pozrráme TV, netflox, skrolujeme social:
<br>- malokedy si uvedomujeme, koľko málo kontroly máme nad vlastnou mysľou
<br>- väčšinu dňa sme na autopilote, náš deň určuje niekto iný
<br>- when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, basic disorder reveals itself - mimd starts to follow random patterns, usually something disturbing, focus on real or imaginary pains
<br>- to avoid, we disteact our attention - TV can provode easily accessibpe information to structure attention at little cost of psychic energy to be invested
<br>
<br>Cultivate memorisation.
<br>Inpast knowledge = memorisation
<br>Declined in presence,education reformed to solve practical problems
<br>A mind with some stable content to it is much richer than one without.
<br>Some of the most original scientosts were well known to have memorised music, poetry extensively.
<br>Memorising that, statistics, biblical verses, quotes - advantageous over someone who havent cultivated such skill - makes you independent from the environment - you can find information in content of your mind. Better companion, finds stimulation.
<br>Memory is stocked with patterns of information - autonomous
<br>
<br>How to memorise
<br>Choose your interest, pay attention to facts from chosen area - dont learn every date at WWI, perhaps you are interested in the role of artillery.
<br>Pay attention to your chosen area.
<br>If you decide what you want to have innmemory, whole process will be a pleasant task, instead of chore imposed from outside.
<br>Once its in your memory, you start feel ownership of content and conectedness when content gets recalled.
<br>People who are motivated to impress others may become boring. 
<br>
<br>Facts are useless unless they finto patterns - find likemessnes and similarities among them (eg giving names to things - creation of categories, numbers(numerical laws), theories)
<br>
<br>If thinkers didnt enjoy sense of order in mind, we wouldnt have maths or philisophy.
<br>
<br>Iceland
<br>- the most poets per capita
<br>- poems to keep mind ordered in hostile conditions
<br>- if they stayed in silence listening to the wind, their minds would be soon filled with despair
<br>- when the world offers no mercy, internal symbolic system can become a salvation.
<br>
<br>Build islamds of sanity surrounded by chaos.
<br>People without symbollic systema are easily manipulatdd by media, sellers
<br>
<br>If we have a lack of internal rules to fall back on, our mind will be taken by those who have answers.
<br>Your call if your mind will be restored from outside, in ways which you have no control, or result of internal pattern that grows organically with your skills and knowledge.

<br>First of all, writing gives the mind a disciplined means of expression. It allows one to record events and experiences so that they can be easily recalled, and relived in the future. It is a way to analyze and understand experiences, a self-communication that brings order to them.

<br>Western Canada, industrial architecture - has gradually learned enough about it to enjoy trips to out-of-the-way sawmills, foundries, and decaying railway depots, where his knowledge enables him to evaluate and appreciate the fine points of what anyone else would dismiss as piles of weedy junk.
<br>
<br>History
<br>But as soon as a person decides which aspects of the past are compelling, and decides to pursue them, focusing on the sources and the details that are personally meaningful, and recording findings in a personal style, then learning history can become a full-fledged flow experience.
<br>
<br>Science
<br>Clearly the necessity of sophisticated laboratories and enormous research teams has been somewhat exaggerated. Breakthroughs in science still depend primarily on the resources of a single mind.
<br>
<br>For several years the researchers did not let anyone else in on their work, not because they were afraid it would be stolen, but because they were afraid that their colleagues would laugh at their seemingly crazy ideas. They received their Nobel prizes for physics in 1987.
<br>
<br>Do what you enjoy.

<br>Isaac Newton formulated his major discoveries soon after he received his B.A. at Cambridge, in 1665, when the university was closed because of the plague. Newton had to spend two years in the safety and boredom of a country retreat, and he filled the time playing with his ideas about a universal theory of gravitation.

<br>When Albert A. Michelson, the first person in the United States to win a Nobel prize in science, was asked at the end of his life why he had devoted so much of his time to measuring the velocity of light, he is said to have replied, “It was so much fun.”
<br>-
<br>Is it really true that a person without a Ph.D., who is not working at one of the major research centers, no longer has any chance of contributing to the advancement of science?

<br>The old woman who farms in the Alps: their work is hard and unglamorous, and most people would find it boring, repetitive, and meaningless. Yet these individuals transformed the jobs they had to do into complex activities. They did this by recognizing opportunities for action where others did not, by developing skills, by focusing on the activity at hand, and allowing themselves to be lost in the interaction so that their selves could emerge stronger afterward. Thus transformed, work becomes enjoyable, and as the result of a personal investment of psychic energy, it feels as if it were freely chosen, as well.
<br>
<br>Before an operation surgeons go through steps of preparation, purification, and dressing up in special garments—like athletes before a contest, or priests before a ceremony. These rituals have a practical purpose, but they also serve to separate celebrants from the concerns of everyday life, and focus their minds on the event to be enacted.
<br>-
<br>Some repeat same routines before operation - eating the same breakfast, wearing the same clothes, and driving to the hospital by the same route. They do so not because they are superstitious, but because they sense that this habitual behavior makes it easier for them to devote their undivided attention to the challenge ahead.

<br>“Listen,” he called, “I want to talk to you.” “Keep going,” they shouted back. But he caught up with the trio, and asked if they would reconsider giving him back the watch they had taken. He explained that it was very cheap, and of no possible value to anyone except him: “You see, it was given to me on my birthday by my parents.”

<br>But what is one to do Sunday morning after breakfast, after having browsed through the papers? For many, the lack of structure of those hours is devastating.
<br>...We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. What if when its lacking?

<br>
<br>Many contemporary artists experiment with hallucinogens in the hope of creating work
<br>Sooner or later, however, they realize that the composition of any work of art requires a sober mind. Work that is carried out under the influence of drugs lacks the complexity we expect from good art
<br>
<br>The habits of pornography and depersonalized sex build on the genetically programmed attraction of images and activities related to reproduction.

<br>How does one keep these problems away?
<br>Disappointments, negative information, health problems
<br>If a person does not know how to control attention in solitude, he will inevitably turn to the easy external solutions: drugs, entertainment, excitement—whatever dulls or distracts the mind.

<br>Family.
<br>
<br>Unequal sharing (inheritance) led to concentration of capital in the lands that used this method, which in turn led to industrialization; whereas equal sharing led to the fragmentation of property and industrial underdevelopment.
<br>
<br>“Those have most power to hurt us that we love.” It is clear that the family can make one very happy, or be an unbearable burden.
<br>
<br>If divorces were rare in the past, it wasn’t because husbands and wives loved each other more in the old times, but because husbands needed someone to cook and keep house, wives needed someone to bring home the bacon, and children needed both parents in order to eat, sleep, and get a start in the world. The “family values” that the elders spent so much effort inculcating in the young were a reflection of this simple necessity, even when it was cloaked in religious and moral considerations.
<br>
<br>The form the human family takes is a response to similar kinds of environmental pressures.
<br>Tam, kde je menej zdrojov, tam prevažuje monogamia - vec voľby.
<br>Rovnako spozorované u vtáctva ako aj u ľudí (mestá vs dediny)
<br>
<br>it is important to consider beforehand how family life can be turned into a flow activity. Because if it is not, boredom and frustration will inevitably set in, and then the relationship is likely to break up unless there are strong external factors keeping it together.
<br>
<br>To provide flow, family has to have a goal for existence.
<br>Positive goals to focus psychic energy
<br>Because everyone is married is not sifficient - wont be enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Family success:
<br>- differentiation: support for everyone to develop traits
<br>- integration: guarantees that what happens to everyone affects others, sharing successes, empathy
<br>
<br>common goals should reflect the goals of individual members as much as possible. I
<br>Provide feedback
<br>Clear communication
<br>-
<br>invest psychic energy in the relationship - conflicts are inevitable, simply because each individual has goals that are to a certain extent divergent from those of all other members of the family
<br>
<br>Sooner or later all children will express the opinion that common family activities are “dumb.”
<br>- forcing them to do things together tends to be counterproductive
<br>- most parents give up, abandon their teenagers to the peer culture. 
<br>- The more fruitful, if more difficult, strategy is to find a new set of activities that will continue to keep the family group involved.
<br>#
<br>
<br>If the parents enjoy playing music, cooking, reading, gardening, carpentry, or fixing engines in the garage, then it is more likely that their children will find similar activities challenging
<br>
<br>Be a source of inspiration
<br>If nothing else,iscussing one’s job or the thoughts and events of the day, and treating children as young adults, as friends, help to socialize them into thoughtful adults. But if the father spends all his free time at home vegetating in front of the TV... 
<br>- child will assume adults are boring and turn to the peers for enjoyment
<br>
<br>Threats replace child's natural playfulness with anxiety - 
<br>If feels parents are commited to his welfare - no need to allocate energy for protection.
<br>
<br>When a family has a common purpose and open channels of communication, when it provides gradually expanding opportunities for action in a setting of trust, then life in it becomes an enjoyable flow activity
<br>
<br>Focus on career - wife and children become cold strangers.
<br>family, like any other joint enterprise, needs constant investments of psychic energy to assure its existence.

<br>Relationships
<br>
<br>When all gambits have been tried,
<br>person’s reactions have become predictable.
<br>becoming a boring routine that might be kept alive by mutual convenience, but is unlikely to provide further enjoyment, or spark a new growth in complexity.
<br>- find new challenges - new convwrsations, travel, cook
<br>- More than anything else they involve paying attention to the partner’s own complexity, getting to know her at deeper levels
<br>
<br>Friendships.
<br>It is only with friends that most people feel they can let their hair down and be themselves. Because we choose friends who share our ultimate goals, these are the people with whom we can sing, dance, share jokes, or go bowling.
<br>Friendship is not enjoyable unless we take up its expressive challenges.
<br>
<br>Those who try to make life better for everyone without having learned to control their own lives first usually end up making things worse all around.
<br>
<br>Handicaps (physical, material)
<br>
<br>incredible examples of how people achieve flow despite extreme handicaps have been collected by Professor Fausto Massimini
<br>- handicaps are seen as positive events - rediscovery yourself, find purpose: eliminate contrary and distracting elements
<br>(Focus on study, build career, start archery, become a wheelchair champion)
<br>- blindness - posotive event that enricjed life: cannot see poor family situation, works as a phone operator: “like I’m God, or something. It is very fulfilling.”
<br>-
<br>“First, although I realize and accept my limitations, I am going to keep attempting to overcome them. Second, I have decided to always try changing those situations I don’t like. Third, I am very careful not to repeat any of the mistakes I make.

<br>
<br>- living with concentrated mind
<br>- It has been more than a trip, it has been a search for identity. Every man has something to discover within himself.
<br>
<br>The people in my town were sure I was crazy when I decided to start walking to Europe. But the best thing in life is to know oneself…
<br>@foundlost
<br>
<br>
<br>I have come to see that the world is not worth much. The only thing that counts for me now, first and last, is God. I am most concentrated when I pray with my prayer beads. Then I am able to put my feelings to sleep, to calm myself and avoid becoming crazy. I believe that destiny rules life, and it makes no sense to struggle too hard
<br>--
<br>Now through prayer I have begun to hear myself, I have returned toward my center, I have achieved concentration and I have understood that the world has no value. Man was born to be tested on this earth. Cars, television sets, clothes are secondary. The main thing is that we were born to praise the Lord.
<br>--
<br>--
<br>to control his consciousness in order to establish a connection between his self and God.
<br>Every man should get to know himself and experience life in all its forms. I could have gone on sleeping soundly in my bed, and found work in my town, because a job was ready for me, but I decided to sleep with the poor, because one must suffer to become a man.  to be a man means to be responsible, to know when it is time to speak, to know what has to be said, to know when one must stay silent.

<br>Copying woth stress.
<br>Firing from job
<br>Immature defense - blami g the world, refusing, starting drinking
<br>Transformational copying/mature defense - keep your cool by supressing your feelings of anger, analyse the problem, move to a place where your skills are in demand, acquire new skills
<br>
<br>Sooner or later everyone will have to comfromt events contradicting to goals: failures, illnesses, financial troubles, inevitability of loses.
<br>Each event is a negative feedback that produces disorder in mind.
<br>If trauma is severe enough, a person may losr ability to concentrate and becomes out of control.
<br>Courage, preservance, mature defence are so essential
<br>Children depend on social network that buffers them from wrong

<br>Whatever goes on you, do your best within the system
<br>- A good pilot knows her skills, has confidence in the machine she is flying, and is aware of what actions are required in case of a hurricane
<br>
<br>- If you cannot make your goal, stop pushing on old goal (get to the office) formulate alternative goal (cannot start car engine cancel the meeting, call a cab)
<br>
<br>People who know how to transform stress into enjoyable challenge spend very little time thinking about themselves.

<br>Autotellic self
<br>
<br>The “autotelic self” is one that easily translates potential threats into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony. A person who is never bored, seldom anxious,
<br>1 set goals from long term commitment (marriage) to a weeekend plan without any fuss and panic
<br>A. to learn tennis i need to learn xyz
<br>B. I liked hitting the ball so i learned to play tennis
<br>
<br>As soon as you know what to do (through goals and actions), suggestion of necessary skills will come in return.
<br>- without attention to feedback i would become less effective
<br>- gives you determination
<br>
<br>People choose unrealistic goals or too trivial - stagnation
<br>
<br>Concentration leads to involvement, which can only be maintained by constant inputs of attention.
<br>People with attention disorders - minds always wandering
<br>
<br>looking at the world exclusively from the little window that one’s self affords is always limiting. 
<br>Even the most highly respected physicist, artist, or politician becomes a hollow bore and ceases to enjoy life if all he can interest himself in is his limited role in the universe.
<br>
<br>- learn to enjoy immedite experience
<br>- to control mind, litterally every moment that happens in life can be a source of joy / feeling breeze on hot day, working on a business, watching children play
<br>.
<br>- requires determination and discipline. To activate flow, stretch capacties, that make you become more than you are
<br>
<br>Turn life into unified flow activity
<br>
<br>- tennis players feel empty when dont play tennis. Bobby Fisher too, when couldnt think of chess, Picasso when couldnt paint
<br>- the mozt rewarding family relationship eventually change/dry - chilldren grow up, move away
<br>- no guarantee that achieved flow activitoes will be carried over forever
<br>- control conciousness - set goal difficult enough, so all other goals follow, invest into developing skills needdd to reach it, then all actions and feelings will be in harmony, all parts of life will fit together - generate feeling to life
<br>
<br>As long as it provides clear objectives, clear rules for action, and a way to concentrate and become involved, any goal can serve to give meaning to a person’s life.
<br>
<br>“What is the meaning of life?” turns out to be astonishingly simple. The meaning of life is meaning: whatever it is, wherever it comes from, a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life.

Once he had set this goal for himself, his resolution was unwavering. He was accepted into law school, clerked for a famous justice, became a judge himself, and at the zenith of his career spent years in the cabinet helping the president develop stronger civil rights policies.
<br>He felt his life had meaning, and enjoyed confronting the challenges that came his way.
<br>
<br>Life themes:
<br>- reaction to a great personal hurt suffered in early life
<br>Trauma is not the cause - its its interperetation
<br>Eg alcoholic parent
<br>-- bastard, tyran
<br>-- he's a man and men are weak and violent
<br>-- poverty is true reason, only way to avoid is to become rich
<br>-- large part of his behavior is a lack of education
<br>----
<br>Bitterness vs life theme, opportunity, find challemge - draw order from disorder
<br>##
<br>
<br>Loss of someone - devoting to defeat the disease - study medicine
<br>
<br>In developing skills to meet that challenge, the individual improves the lives of other people.
