<br>Happiness - individually crafted. No recipe exists, but tyere are principles.
<br>
<br>People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy.
<br>
<br>“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself"
<br>Viktor Frankl

<br>
<br>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen.
<br>#
<br>- child: breaking own record
<br>- violinist: mastering a passage
<br>
<br>Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life.
<br>
<br>What would really satisfy people is not getting slim or rich, but feeling good about their lives.
<br>-happiness: partial solutions dont work
<br>
<br>A person who has achieved control over psychic energy and has invested it in consciously chosen goals cannot help but grow into a more complex being. By stretching skills, by reaching toward higher challenges, such a person becomes an increasingly extraordinary individual.
<br>
<br>As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”
<br>
<br>For the majority of people on this earth, life goals are simple: to survive, to leave children who will in turn survive, and, if possible, to do so with a certain amount of comfort and dignity.
<br>As long as basic needs for survival are solved, having enough food and shelter, new needs are felt - rising expectations - power, wealth, comfort.
<br>
<br>In threadmill of rising expectations, many individuals found way to escape it - regardless of their material conditions, have been able to improve the quality of their lives, who are satisfied,.
<br>Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in CONTROL of their lives.
<br>
<br>When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.
<br>- great civilisations At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback - Romans: confidence after centuries of ruling Mediterranean, Chinese - feeling superior until Mongols, Aztects until Spanish
<br>-
<br>Unwaranted sense of security sooner or later results in rude awakening
<br>#
<br>
<br>During the years of early adulthood the future still looks promising, the hope remains that one’s goals will be realized. But inevitably the bathroom mirror shows the first white hairs,...
<br>When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?”
<br>
<br>some will just surrender and retire gracefully into relative oblivion. Following Candide’s advice, they will give up on the world and cultivate their little gardens. They might dabble in genteel forms of escape such as developing a harmless hobby
<br>
<br>If values and institutions no longer provide as supportive a framework as they once did, each person must use whatever tools are available to carve out a meaningful, enjoyable life.
<br>
<br>To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.
<br>-
<br>Requires a discipline and perseverance
<br>##
<br>
<br>The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment.
<br>-
<br>If a person learns to enjoy and find meaning in the ongoing stream of experience, in the process of living itself, the burden of social controls automatically falls from one’s shoulders. Power returns to the person when rewards are no longer relegated to outside forces.
<br>
<br>People have known for thousands of years what it takes to become free and in control of one’s life, why haven’t we made more progress in this direction?
<br>- like any kind Re f expertise it needs to be learnt, earmed by trial and error by each individual, generation after generation.
<br>- CONTROL over CONCIOUSNESS is not a cognitive skill
<br>
<br>Control over conciousness cannot be instituniolized
<br>Marx - liberation from economic tyranny turned into syystem of opression
<br>Dostoyensky - , if Christ had returned to preach his message of liberation in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name.
<br>
<br>We all know individuals who can transform hopeless situations into challenges to be overcome, just through the force of their personalities. 
<br>#
<br>
<br>This ability to persevere despite obstacles and setbacks is the quality people most admire in others, and justly so; it is probably the most important trait not only for succeeding in life, but for enjoying it as well.
<br>
<br>Being a specialist, he cannot afford the time or the mental energy to do anything other than fine-tune his skill
<br>
<br>ATTENTION
<br>
<br>
<br>While we are thinking about a problem we cannot truly experience either happiness or sadness. 
<br>We cannot run, sing, and balance the checkbook simultaneously, because each one of these activities exhausts most of our capacity for attention.
<br>
<br>Short term memory
<br>It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information
<br>#
<br>
<br>because it is moving very slowly, or because of its unusual appearance. The image of the unusual car enters the focus of consciousness, and we become aware of it.
<br>
<br>As soon as the event is matched to an already known class of events, it is identified. Now it must be evaluated: Is this something to worry about? If the answer is yes, then we must decide on an appropriate course of action: Should we speed up, slow down, change lanes
<br>
<br>there is a distinct process that makes such reactions possible, a process called attention. It is attention that selects the relevant bits of information from the potential millions of bits available.
<br>
<br>Retrieving information from memory storage and bringing it into the focus of awareness, comparing information, evaluating, deciding—all make demands on the mind’s limited processing capacity
<br>
<br>The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.

<br>E.
<br>Not one minute of her life is wasted.
<br>"Very little of her time is spemt on routine functions of her life"
<br>Miving among several residences around world, travels constantly
<br>Usually she is writing, solving problems, reading
<br>While she is at the meeting, her chauffeur instead of waiting will be expected to visit local art gallery or museum, for on her way home she will want to discuss what he thought of its paintings
<br>Ea h day she devotes some time to recharging her mind - facing the lakeshore for 15 mins, facing the sun with eyes closefld, or taking hounds for walk
<br>Poverty, health - she recovered from everything by disciplininv her attention and refusing to difuse ot from unproductive thoughts and activities.
<br>She radiates pure glow of energy
<br>
<br>R.
<br>Although he is known to only a few, his reputation among them is very great.
<br>-
<br>As he talks, his eyes take in everything; every sentence he hears is analyzed three or four different ways even before the speaker has finished saying it.
<br>-
<br>R. gives the impression of restfulness, of calm serenity.
<br>-
<br>But R. does not notice things in order to change them or judge them. He is content to register reality, to understand, and then, perhaps, to express his understanding
<br>
<br>Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable.
<br>#
<br>
<br>We create ourselves by how we invest this energy. Memories, thoughts, and feelings are all shaped by how we use it.
<br>
<br>A musician structures her attention so as to focus on nuances of sound that ordinary people are not aware of, a stockbroker focuses on tiny changes in the market that others do not register
<br>
<br>Sam had no clearly differentiated goals; he wanted exactly what other boys his age are supposed to want,because of what the social environment told them to - he thought vaguely of going to college, then later finding some kind of well-paying job, getting married, and living somewhere in the suburbs. In Bermuda, Sam’s father took him on an excursion to a coral barrier, and they dove underwater to explore the reef. Sam couldn’t believe his eyes. He found the mysterious, beautifully dangerous environment so enchanting that he decided to become more familiar with it. He ended up taking a number of biology courses in high school, and is now in the process of becoming a marine scientist.
<br>
<br>psychic disorder— information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out.
<br>Pain, fear, jealousy
<br>Psychic energy becomes unwieldy and ineffective.
<br>
<br>even the usually boring routines of work become purposeful and enjoyable.
<br>- assembly line worker - beating his record like an athlete
<br>- lawyer - deeply focused on working on complex cases
<br>- quality of life improves if wlyoure able to organize your conciousness as so experience flows.
<br>#
<br>
<br>“It’s exhilarating to come closer and closer to self-discipline. You make your body go and everything hurts; then you look back in awe at the self, at what you’ve done, it just blows your mind. It leads to ecstasy, to self-fulfillment
<br>
<br>If you are not in control of your conciousness, old fears and desires will return soon.
<br>Even buying an island and surrounding with armed bodyguards will not make you feel secured.
<br>
<br>Wealth, status, power - symbols of happines in our culture.
<br>Rich, famous and good-looking people are seen as famous, although all evidence is showing misery.
<br>These symbols dont make us happier - instead they distract from REALITY they are supposed to represent - quality of life depends how we feel of ourselves.
<br>To improve life one must improve quality of experience
<br>###
<br>
<br>Not saying they are irrelevant to happiness - blesaings if they help us feel better.
<br>(Eg money can increase happines, depending how it is used)
<br>
<br>Instead of thinking how to make a million or win people and influence people think how to make every day satisfying.
<br>
<br>ENJOYMENT
<br>
<br>invest psychic energy in goals that are new, that are relatively challenging. 
<br>- children: trying out new movements, new words daily. The rapt concentration on the child’s face as she learns each new skill is a good indication of what enjoyment is about. And each instance of enjoyable learning adds to the complexity of the child’s developing self.
<br>
<br>Without enjoyment life can still be pleasant - depending on luck and external conditions.
<br>- to gain control over life, learn how to build enjoyment
<br>#
<br>
<br>1. Challlenging activity that requires skills
<br>
<br>Ability to manipulate symbolic information is a skill.
<br>Reading - translate words into images, recognize contexts, emphatize with characters, anticipate turns of plot
<br>Maths - shape quamtitati e relationships in head
<br>
<br>Game
<br>- keep difficulty of game constant to skills/condition of player (if he's tired - dog running in tighter circles making easier to catch)
<br>- by bancing experience and skills the game would yeld maximum of enjoyment for all players
<br>
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>FLOW
<br>Concentrated deeply focused experience
<br>
<br>- goals are usually clear, feedback immediate (why to build focus). At any moment always know what to do, immediataly know you did well or bad
<br>##
<br>
<br>Trivial goal doesnt provide enjoyment.
<br>
<br>In creative activities, when goals cannot be set in advance, person needs to develop a sense of what he intends to.
<br>- The artist might not have a visual image of what the finished painting should look like, but when the picture has progressed to a certain point, she should know whether this is what she wanted to achieve or not.
<br>
<br>The concentration of the flow experience—together with clear goals and immediate feedback—provides order to consciousness, inducing the enjoyable condition of psychic negentropy.
<br>
<br>Distraction from real world problems
<br>Addiction
