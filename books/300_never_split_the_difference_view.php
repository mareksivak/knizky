<br>* application of game theory and empathy/emotional design
<br>##
<br>
<br>Use empathy, not because you're a nice guy but because it works
<br>
<br>You will make mistakes but they won't be the end of everything.
<br>Let yoursek´lf do mistakes, it's gonna be ok
<br>
<br>Thank you for spending a day with me I completely enjoyed being here.
<br>
<br>---
<br>What's important to you.Everybody has a goal - something from future, if they won't get it, they are ruined. Read what's on their cards.
<br>I will let you react. Open trust: -Here'swhats important to me. You gotta tell me what you need me to tell what you need to make the deal.
<br>Listen to the answer. You lose if you don't and think of your next move regardless the answer.
<br>--
<br>Open up to show cards - we never know how our cards overlap without opening them up - that requires trust.
<br>
<br>Start with baseline (jednoduché otázky, na ktoré povie pravdu - čo si mal na raňajky, koľko máš detí) jump to tough one - what's important for you
<br>People start lying, look down - signs of discomfort - "seems something is bothering you"
<br>--
<br>Sometimes it's in your interest to show what's in your cards. You may get a better deal than you wanted
<br>--
<br>If I take you 5 dollars, it will hurt you 2x more than delight if I gave you 10
<br>--
<br>Goal of negotiation is not today YES, but THA TS RIGHT.  Not you're right
<br>
<br>People yell because they are not heard
<br>
<br>Ask people who know how to do, go to do and do it. It sounds stupid
<br>
<br>If you get people to say some littleYes, they are more likely to say a big Yes
<br>Every question has impact. Every time you get someone say yes you create anxiety in that person
<br>--sounds stupid, but get the we m to say no
<br>-- cold calling: can I speak with you? Do you want to make more money? -> get to say 3 yes and then lunch with your main call (ask for money,...)
<br>NO script - 25 percent higher success rate: get to say 3 no. Have you given up visiting The White House? Vs Have you been to the WH?
<br>
<br>Little yes (do you have a few mins to talk - how long?)is a trap - never ever do - opposite happens
<br>Do you want an author to come to your show? How many people are approaching by trying to say yes
<br>Tell: *is it a ridiculous idea if you come and speak to* (add value, subject) course?
<br>*Do you want me to fail?*
<br>
<br>Ronald Reagan: next week you gonna go to voting booth. (Draw a picture - get attention by telling what they're facing)
<br>Are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier Togo to store and buy things than it was r years ago? Are we stronger than we were 4 years ago?
<br>If you answered yes, your choice is clear
<br>If you don't agree. If you don't agree this course we've been on is what you would yould like to see us for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice you have
<br>(He was other choice vs Jimmy Carter)
<br>
<br>
<br>There is a chanceyoudont remember me. I will show you I remember youwell - hey Steve, how's life, how are kids doing Steve. Steve Steve Steve...
<br>I want them to be successful
<br>Send them emal - have you given up on doing business with me? Must replying three mins
<br>
<br>
<br>Guy leaving voicemails
<br>Youcannot getadeal ok f you don't let them to know you
<br>
<br>If I only talked and you listened, I would be wasting your time.  Why would I do that
<br>
<br>Be calm, relaxed, don't rush. Most sales people want to be done quickly
<br>That why smiles and makes more deals than I do -> these things are learned
<br>Patience makes other side less pushed
<br>It's like silence effective pauses - a weapon - the more patient you are the more order person feels their autonomy is respected, easier to respond to you
<br>"We're gonna delay things in order to save time"
<br>People who are direct and action oriented (boss asks when will we get it done) need twice long to get things done as guys who are relaxed
<br>Atlanta 3 hr, Portland 8hr
<br>
<br>We make decisions based on what we care about - that makes decisions emotional
<br>> Negatives are 3 times more powerful than positives
<br>
<br>I want them to build trust to open up,if there's some bad news I will tell them
<br>Build trust - show knowledge- you know something about market
<br>Predictability is important - I don't want surprises
<br>
<br>
<br>It's big thing if you look at all at once. You need to break it down
<br>-i will let that person talk andparaphrase all they say - counterintuitive tactics to avoid getting into habit
<br>
<br>If you say so you think the deal won't work
<br>I'd look why you think it won't work - i would look for hesitation
<br>If someone gives you hesitation (okaaaay....) They are waiting to pick it up from there
<br>
<br>You,re right is Sam as Fuck you
<br>You want them to stop talking
<br>
<br>Resume correlates losly with weather you do the job or not
<br>When you're asked how are you gonna help, don't tell your resume - it's a mistake (FBI expert, author of books, government trustee)
<br>-tell youreknowledgeable about their problem. You have lessthan10 seconds. Show them what they are looking at. Show them you are able to find solutions they need
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>Handling unreasonable request. Anywhere.
<br>We have your son
<br>-How am I supposed to give you 1M dollars?
<br>-I’m sorry Robert, how do I even know hes even alive?
<br>——employ most potent tool: open ended question
<br>——sorry, fname: make conversation warmer, make them to solve your problems
<br>4
<br>
<br>Intellectual superiority: wear khakis with relaxed confidence
<br>
<br>A lucky one-off was one thing. But this time it was pattern
<br>
<br>Those guys were smart, but they were playing the same game with the same rules. I had skills they didnt
<br>
<br>Ask  same 4 open ended questions over and over. They get worn out and tell you what you need. Sounds like saying no until they fall apart

<br>
<br>Negotiation therries - all in rational frames (do a,b,c, get d)
<br>People are impulsive emotional animals, negotiation is unpredictable
<br>
<br>Framing effect - people respond differently  to the same choice depending how its framed (greater value in moving from 90 to 100 than from 45 to 55)
<br>Loss aversion - people statistically more likely act to avert a loss than achieve equal gain
<br>
<br>System 1 - animal mind, fast, instinctive, emotional
<br>System 2 - slow, logical
<br>System 1 mire influential, steers our rational thoughts
<br>-we react emotionally S1 to questions or suggestions. Then S1 reaction creates S2 answer (spring that feeds river)
<br>-Affect counterparts thinking by how you frame questions and statements, then you can guide his rationality S2 and modify responses
<br>-How am i supposed to do that? -> influence S1 that offer is not good enough, S2 will rationalise situation and gives you better offer

<br>
<br>Cognitive bias - brain process that dissorts way we see the world
<br>
<br>Getting to say Yes, doesnt work for complex negotiations (how would you divise a mutual win-win with someone who think is a messiah)?
<br>—rational thinking
<br>—negotiate in dymamic, intense, uncertain environment, emotional crisis and no clwar demands?
<br>
<br>Developing positive relationships
<br>Listening is the cheapest, yet the most effective confession
<br>By listening intensely, you demonstrate empathy and shows sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
<br>16

<br>
<br>Negotiation - information gsthering and behavior influencing
<br>-nothing more than communication with results
<br>-its a collaboration, it can make confluct productive for all parties
<br>17
<br>
<br>-Negotiation starts sith No - get them to say no
<br>-Eliminate Yes/No questions to force them to solve your problems
<br>-Discover importance of nonverbal communication: how to use How to gently say No, how to get counterparts bid against themselves
<br>20
<br>
<br>Myself - hardworkimg, willing to learn, but not particularly talented
<br>I knew life holds amazing possibilities, didnt know how to unlock them.
<br>With skolls I have learned, i found myself doing extraordinary things and watching people i have taught achieve life changing results
<br>When I use what i learned over past 30 years i have power to change where the course of my life is going

<br>
<br>Too often people find it easier to stick with what they believe. Using biases and assumptions they mock up their version of the world - unchanging amd often flawed
<br>Great players are able to question assuptioms that the rest accepts on faith or in ignorance, and thus remain more emotionally open and intellectually agile to all possibilities and fluid situation
<br>25
<br>####
<br>
<br>Use of personal pronouns - we, they vs me, I - the less important you make yourself, the more important you probably are
<br>26
<br>
<br>Spoke with a voice of complete calm and absolute confidence
<br>
<br>Everything we assumed we knew was wrong
<br>
<br>We are easily distracted - we engage in selective listening, hearing on what we want to hear, our minds act on cognitive bias for considtency rather than truth
<br>27
<br>
<br>We can process only about 7 pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment
<br>George Miller

<br>
<br>In discussion people tent to listen voices in their heads. Instead of prioritising your argument, disarm counterpart by listening - focus on what what they want to say. You will make them feel safe
<br>Then identify their need (monetarily, emotionally,...) and get them feel safe enough - then they will talk about what they want - wants are easy to talk about, cost you nothing, representing aspiration, sustain illusion of control and show vulnerability.
<br>—
<br>Listen, validate emotions, create trust and and safety for real conversation
<br>28

<br>
<br>Slow it down
<br>Problem was we were so much in hurry, , driving too hard toward quick solutions, tryimg to be people solver, not a people mover.

<br>
<br>Late night DJ voice
<br>Joe’s gone. Now you are talking to me.
<br>Deal done
<br>No alternative goven that would beg further discussion
<br>You van be very direct to the point as long as you create safety by tone (low and deep) of voice.
<br>34
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-Repeat last or most critical 3 words
<br>You chased my driver away
<br>We chased your driver away?
<br>Unconscious response - building trust, bonding - speech, tone, body language patterns
<br>We fear of whats different and draw to whats similar
<br>-Trigger to make counterpart elaborate and sustain comnection
<br>36
<br>
<br>Totally outrged
<br>He responded like a pitbull backed into a corner. Called Dominick a liar.
<br>Dominick kept his cool - it brought guy from boil to simmer
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-only weapon When need to deal with aggressive, impulsive person in position of authority
<br>-When person’s voice is incosistent with words
<br>1 late night FM DJ voice - use selectively to make a point - keep calm and slow - create authority
<br>2 Start with Im sorry (shows respect and concern)
<br>3 mirror and silence
<br>4 repeat
<br>—
<br>Lets do two copies. Im dorry, two copies? (Help me understand)
<br>You can store it anywhere. Anywhere?
<br>45
<br>
<br>Negotiation os not a battle of arguments (listening own voice). Its a discovery
<br>
<br>Think of oprah - taking to people she never met, in front of millions getting them to open up
<br>Smile to ease tension, subtle verbal and non verbal communication to signal empathy and thus security, embrace specific kind of question and avoid others
<br>
<br>—-
<br>Dont feel their pain, label it
<br>—-
<br>
<br>Emotions have been seen as an obstacle to good outcome. Separate people from problem, they said
<br>Emotions are their problem - fears, delights
<br>49
<br>#
<br>
<br>Instead of deniying emotions, good negotiator identifies and influences them.
<br>50
<br>#
<br>
<br>Imagine yourself in their place
<br>-it looks you dont want to come out. It looks like you dont want to go to jail
<br>
<br>Ignoring other person’s position builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want
<br>
<br>Agreeing is sympathy
<br>
<br>Tactical empathy - seeing from another persons point of view while they are talking to them and assess whats driving them
<br>
<br>Best officers know if they empathize, they can talk to their audiences
<br>52
<br>
<br>Closely observe persons face, gestures, tone of voice and our brainaligns with them. Neural resonance
<br>
<br>Labelling
<br>Once you spot emotion, label it aloud. Give neutral star.ent
<br>It sounds like...
<br>It seems like...
<br>It looks like...
<br>++go silent
<br>-disagreements are okay, say it didnt say that. It just looks like that
<br>#
<br>56
<br>
<br>Try it out - label on of the persons emotions in any conversation and see the change
<br>
<br>Grumpy grandfather
<br>He’s grumpy because he never sees his family and feels keft out
<br>Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior address his sadness in non judgemental way. Head off his cincern before you start
<br>Notice how it acknowledges situation and labels saddness
<br>-We dont see each other that often
<br>-It seems you feel like we dont pay enough attention to you
<br>59
<br>
<br>Research shows to deal with negativity without reaction and judgement. Then label each negative feeling and replace with more positive, compassionate and constructive thought
<br>59
<br>#
<br>
<br>-I want to inform you,....
<br>Stupidly aggressive, *impersonal*, tone deaff communication default for the most businesses
<br>No acknowledgement on their situation
<br>No empathy, no connection, just give me money
<br>60
<br>
<br>Rewrite the script, no massive changes, no discounts
<br>Build deep emotional resonance,
<br>Acknowledge not only their but yours debt as well
<br>-Now its YOUR team, purpose of the call is to ensure that the most valuable fans would be at the season opener
<br>-in these difficult times our fans have been hit hard, asked to talk back thiuugh their Unique situation

<br>
<br>The faster you remove obstacles, the quicker you generate feelings of safety, wellbeing, and trust
<br>
<br>Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer
