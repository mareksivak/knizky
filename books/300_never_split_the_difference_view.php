<br>* application of game theory and empathy/emotional design
<br>##
<br>
<br>Use empathy, not because you're a nice guy but because it works
<br>
<br>You will make mistakes but they won't be the end of everything.
<br>Let yoursek´lf do mistakes, it's gonna be ok
<br>
<br>Thank you for spending a day with me I completely enjoyed being here.
<br>
<br>---
<br>What's important to you.Everybody has a goal - something from future, if they won't get it, they are ruined. Read what's on their cards.
<br>I will let you react. Open trust: -Here'swhats important to me. You gotta tell me what you need me to tell what you need to make the deal.
<br>Listen to the answer. You lose if you don't and think of your next move regardless the answer.
<br>--
<br>Open up to show cards - we never know how our cards overlap without opening them up - that requires trust.
<br>
<br>Start with baseline (jednoduché otázky, na ktoré povie pravdu - čo si mal na raňajky, koľko máš detí) jump to tough one - what's important for you
<br>People start lying, look down - signs of discomfort - "seems something is bothering you"
<br>--
<br>Sometimes it's in your interest to show what's in your cards. You may get a better deal than you wanted
<br>--
<br>If I take you 5 dollars, it will hurt you 2x more than delight if I gave you 10
<br>--
<br>Goal of negotiation is not today YES, but THA TS RIGHT.  Not you're right
<br>
<br>People yell because they are not heard
<br>
<br>Ask people who know how to do, go to do and do it. It sounds stupid
<br>
<br>If you get people to say some littleYes, they are more likely to say a big Yes
<br>Every question has impact. Every time you get someone say yes you create anxiety in that person
<br>--sounds stupid, but get the we m to say no
<br>-- cold calling: can I speak with you? Do you want to make more money? -> get to say 3 yes and then lunch with your main call (ask for money,...)
<br>NO script - 25 percent higher success rate: get to say 3 no. Have you given up visiting The White House? Vs Have you been to the WH?
<br>
<br>Little yes (do you have a few mins to talk - how long?)is a trap - never ever do - opposite happens
<br>Do you want an author to come to your show? How many people are approaching by trying to say yes
<br>Tell: *is it a ridiculous idea if you come and speak to* (add value, subject) course?
<br>*Do you want me to fail?*
<br>
<br>Ronald Reagan: next week you gonna go to voting booth. (Draw a picture - get attention by telling what they're facing)
<br>Are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier Togo to store and buy things than it was r years ago? Are we stronger than we were 4 years ago?
<br>If you answered yes, your choice is clear
<br>If you don't agree. If you don't agree this course we've been on is what you would yould like to see us for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice you have
<br>(He was other choice vs Jimmy Carter)
<br>
<br>
<br>There is a chanceyoudont remember me. I will show you I remember youwell - hey Steve, how's life, how are kids doing Steve. Steve Steve Steve...
<br>I want them to be successful
<br>Send them emal - have you given up on doing business with me? Must replying three mins
<br>
<br>
<br>Guy leaving voicemails
<br>Youcannot getadeal ok f you don't let them to know you
<br>
<br>If I only talked and you listened, I would be wasting your time.  Why would I do that
<br>
<br>Be calm, relaxed, don't rush. Most sales people want to be done quickly
<br>That why smiles and makes more deals than I do -> these things are learned
<br>Patience makes other side less pushed
<br>It's like silence effective pauses - a weapon - the more patient you are the more order person feels their autonomy is respected, easier to respond to you
<br>"We're gonna delay things in order to save time"
<br>People who are direct and action oriented (boss asks when will we get it done) need twice long to get things done as guys who are relaxed
<br>Atlanta 3 hr, Portland 8hr
<br>
<br>We make decisions based on what we care about - that makes decisions emotional
<br>> Negatives are 3 times more powerful than positives
<br>
<br>I want them to build trust to open up,if there's some bad news I will tell them
<br>Build trust - show knowledge- you know something about market
<br>Predictability is important - I don't want surprises
<br>
<br>
<br>It's big thing if you look at all at once. You need to break it down
<br>-i will let that person talk andparaphrase all they say - counterintuitive tactics to avoid getting into habit
<br>
<br>If you say so you think the deal won't work
<br>I'd look why you think it won't work - i would look for hesitation
<br>If someone gives you hesitation (okaaaay....) They are waiting to pick it up from there
<br>
<br>You,re right is Sam as Fuck you
<br>You want them to stop talking
<br>
<br>Resume correlates losly with weather you do the job or not
<br>When you're asked how are you gonna help, don't tell your resume - it's a mistake (FBI expert, author of books, government trustee)
<br>-tell youreknowledgeable about their problem. You have lessthan10 seconds. Show them what they are looking at. Show them you are able to find solutions they need
<br>
<br>
<br>---

<br>
<br>Handling unreasonable request. Anywhere.
<br>We have your son
<br>-How am I supposed to give you 1M dollars?
<br>-I’m sorry Robert, how do I even know hes even alive?
<br>——employ most potent tool: open ended question
<br>——sorry, fname: make conversation warmer, make them to solve your problems
<br>4
<br>
<br>Intellectual superiority: wear khakis with relaxed confidence
<br>
<br>A lucky one-off was one thing. But this time it was pattern
<br>
<br>Those guys were smart, but they were playing the same game with the same rules. I had skills they didnt
<br>
<br>Ask  same 4 open ended questions over and over. They get worn out and tell you what you need. Sounds like saying no until they fall apart
<br>7
<br>
<br>Negotiation therries - all in rational frames (do a,b,c, get d)
<br>People are impulsive emotional animals, negotiation is unpredictable
<br>
<br>Framing effect - people respond differently  to the same choice depending how its framed (greater value in moving from 90 to 100 than from 45 to 55)
<br>Loss aversion - people statistically more likely act to avert a loss than achieve equal gain
<br>
<br>System 1 - animal mind, fast, instinctive, emotional
<br>System 2 - slow, logical
<br>System 1 mire influential, steers our rational thoughts
<br>-we react emotionally S1 to questions or suggestions. Then S1 reaction creates S2 answer (spring that feeds river)
<br>-Affect counterparts thinking by how you frame questions and statements, then you can guide his rationality S2 and modify responses
<br>-How am i supposed to do that? -> influence S1 that offer is not good enough, S2 will rationalise situation and gives you better offer
<br>13

<br>
<br>Cognitive bias - brain process that dissorts way we see the world
<br>
<br>Getting to say Yes, doesnt work for complex negotiations (how would you divise a mutual win-win with someone who think is a messiah)?
<br>—rational thinking
<br>—negotiate in dymamic, intense, uncertain environment, emotional crisis and no clwar demands?
<br>
<br>Developing positive relationships
<br>Listening is the cheapest, yet the most effective confession
<br>By listening intensely, you demonstrate empathy and shows sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
<br>16

<br>
<br>Negotiation - information gsthering and behavior influencing
<br>-nothing more than communication with results
<br>-its a collaboration, it can make confluct productive for all parties
<br>17
<br>
<br>-Negotiation starts sith No - get them to say no
<br>-Eliminate Yes/No questions to force them to solve your problems
<br>-Discover importance of nonverbal communication: how to use How to gently say No, how to get counterparts bid against themselves
<br>20
<br>
<br>Myself - hardworkimg, willing to learn, but not particularly talented
<br>I knew life holds amazing possibilities, didnt know how to unlock them.
<br>With skolls I have learned, i found myself doing extraordinary things and watching people i have taught achieve life changing results
<br>When I use what i learned over past 30 years i have power to change where the course of my life is going

<br>
<br>Too often people find it easier to stick with what they believe. Using biases and assumptions they mock up their version of the world - unchanging amd often flawed
<br>Great players are able to question assuptioms that the rest accepts on faith or in ignorance, and thus remain more emotionally open and intellectually agile to all possibilities and fluid situation
<br>25
<br>####
<br>
<br>Use of personal pronouns - we, they vs me, I - the less important you make yourself, the more important you probably are
<br>26
<br>
<br>Spoke with a voice of complete calm and absolute confidence
<br>
<br>Everything we assumed we knew was wrong
<br>
<br>We are easily distracted - we engage in selective listening, hearing on what we want to hear, our minds act on cognitive bias for considtency rather than truth
<br>27
<br>
<br>We can process only about 7 pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment
<br>George Miller
<br>28
<br>
<br>In discussion people tent to listen voices in their heads. Instead of prioritising your argument, disarm counterpart by listening - focus on what what they want to say. You will make them feel safe
<br>Then identify their need (monetarily, emotionally,...) and get them feel safe enough - then they will talk about what they want - wants are easy to talk about, cost you nothing, representing aspiration, sustain illusion of control and show vulnerability.
<br>—
<br>Listen, validate emotions, create trust and and safety for real conversation
<br>28
<br>##
<br>
<br>Slow it down
<br>Problem was we were so much in hurry, , driving too hard toward quick solutions, tryimg to be people solver, not a people mover.

<br>
<br>Late night DJ voice
<br>Joe’s gone. Now you are talking to me.
<br>Deal done
<br>No alternative goven that would beg further discussion
<br>You van be very direct to the point as long as you create safety by tone (low and deep) of voice.
<br>34
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-Repeat last or most critical 3 words
<br>You chased my driver away
<br>We chased your driver away?
<br>Unconscious response - building trust, bonding - speech, tone, body language patterns
<br>We fear of whats different and draw to whats similar
<br>-Trigger to make counterpart elaborate and sustain comnection
<br>36
<br>
<br>Totally outrged
<br>He responded like a pitbull backed into a corner. Called Dominick a liar.
<br>Dominick kept his cool - it brought guy from boil to simmer
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-only weapon When need to deal with aggressive, impulsive person in position of authority
<br>-When person’s voice is incosistent with words
<br>1 late night FM DJ voice - use selectively to make a point - keep calm and slow - create authority
<br>2 Start with Im sorry (shows respect and concern)
<br>3 mirror and silence
<br>4 repeat
<br>—
<br>Lets do two copies. Im dorry, two copies? (Help me understand)
<br>You can store it anywhere. Anywhere?
<br>45
<br>
<br>Negotiation os not a battle of arguments (listening own voice). Its a discovery
<br>
<br>Think of oprah - taking to people she never met, in front of millions getting them to open up
<br>Smile to ease tension, subtle verbal and non verbal communication to signal empathy and thus security, embrace specific kind of question and avoid others
<br>
<br>—-
<br>Dont feel their pain, label it
<br>—-
<br>
<br>Emotions have been seen as an obstacle to good outcome. Separate people from problem, they said
<br>Emotions are their problem - fears, delights
<br>49
<br>#
<br>
<br>Instead of deniying emotions, good negotiator identifies and influences them.
<br>50
<br>#
<br>
<br>Imagine yourself in their place
<br>-it looks you dont want to come out. It looks like you dont want to go to jail
<br>
<br>Ignoring other person’s position builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want
<br>
<br>Agreeing is sympathy
<br>
<br>Tactical empathy - seeing from another persons point of view while they are talking to them and assess whats driving them
<br>
<br>Best officers know if they empathize, they can talk to their audiences
<br>52
<br>
<br>Closely observe persons face, gestures, tone of voice and our brainaligns with them. Neural resonance
<br>
<br>Labelling
<br>Once you spot emotion, label it aloud. Give neutral star.ent
<br>It sounds like...
<br>It seems like...
<br>It looks like...
<br>++go silent
<br>-disagreements are okay, say it didnt say that. It just looks like that
<br>#
<br>56
<br>
<br>Try it out - label on of the persons emotions in any conversation and see the change
<br>
<br>Grumpy grandfather
<br>He’s grumpy because he never sees his family and feels keft out
<br>Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior address his sadness in non judgemental way. Head off his cincern before you start
<br>Notice how it acknowledges situation and labels saddness
<br>-We dont see each other that often
<br>-It seems you feel like we dont pay enough attention to you
<br>59
<br>
<br>Research shows to deal with negativity without reaction and judgement. Then label each negative feeling and replace with more positive, compassionate and constructive thought
<br>59
<br>#
<br>
<br>-I want to inform you,....
<br>Stupidly aggressive, *impersonal*, tone deaff communication default for the most businesses
<br>No acknowledgement on their situation
<br>No empathy, no connection, just give me money
<br>60
<br>
<br>Rewrite the script, no massive changes, no discounts
<br>Build deep emotional resonance,
<br>Acknowledge not only their but yours debt as well
<br>-Now its YOUR team, purpose of the call is to ensure that the most valuable fans would be at the season opener
<br>-in these difficult times our fans have been hit hard, asked to talk back thiuugh their Unique situation
<br>61##
<br>
<br>The faster you remove obstacles, the quicker you generate feelings of safety, wellbeing, and trust
<br>
<br>Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer

<br>Don't be demoralised if process goes slowly
<br>
<br>Showing projects to potential donor.
<br>Shook head above each.
<br>-hold your emotions
<br>-i can see some hesitation with these project //say in low voice
<br>...
<br>//could focus conversation, but difficult Donor still not interested, can sense growing frustration
<br>-it seems you are very passionate about your gift and want to find right project reflecting opportunities you received
<br>Signed a check without picking project - you understand me, I trust you can find the right one 
<br>-- she had fear that her money would be misappropriated -- first question uncovered that - obstacle wasn't finding right match, obstacle was she needed to understand why she

<br>When I ask class for volunteering they are all shy.
<br>I say "for those of you interesting in volunteering in front of class, I want to tell you in advance -it's gonna be horrible. And those who volunteer will get more out of that than anybody else"
<br>-- I labeled audience's fears - how much can be soˇeyhing worse than horrible?
<br>#
<br>
<br>We start criticism "I don't want to sound harsh, I don't want to be an asshole" - this denies negative
<br>-list out every negative thing counterpart would think and say it
<br>###
<br>-disarm counterpart while negotiating everything from son's bedtime to business
<br>-defense lawyers in court mention all weaknesses and everything their client is accused of in their opening statement - take the sting out
<br>(This is not a good situation and we appreciate the fact you are acknowledging what happens, we don't think you are mistreating us)
<br>-creates safe zone for empathy
<br>
<br>Use the same method to acknowledge experience
<br>
<br>You need to instrument different techniques
<br>Labelling: previous customers seemed upset, seems this is a hectic time for you -acknowledge her situation, I hear you, build relationship.
<br>Labels,empathy, request (use information you received): you are handling this pretty well. I also missed my flight. Flight seems to be full, but as you said, someone might miss due to weather. Is there possibility any seat will be open?
<br>-ackniwledging situation work, if there is upset customer, take it to your advantage
<br>
<br>Empathy - it pleases us to feel listened and acknowledged
<br>##
<br>Create empathetic connection and encourage counterpart to expand on their situation - these tools will help you create warm relationships
<br>Practice. May feel awkward at first
<br>72#
<br>
<br>Once they know you are listening, they may tell you something you can use
<br>
<br>-reasons for No may be more powerful than them. Make sure you remove barriers for clear communication
<br>-pause. After you label barriers. Let them fill the silence
<br>-you are dealing with person who wants to be appreciated a d undersood. Reinforce positive perceptions
<br>
<br>Many try to keep staying with Yes flow - no is a death to discussion. Shared interest cannot be found
<br>But yes is meaninglessness hides deeper objections. 
<br>Maybe even worse
<br>Saying yes makes you uncomfortable, No is a pure relief
<br>-
<br>No is pure gold for good negotiators
<br>Opportunity to clarify what you really want
<br>No maintains status quo, provides control
<br>##
<br>When you come to realize the real psychological dynamic behind it, you’ll love the word. It’s not just that you lose your fear of it, but that you come to learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out of it. 
<br>
<br>Success hostage negotiation
<br>Penetrate takers motives, state of mind, intelligence, emotional strengths and weaknesses 
<br>
<br>No
<br>No
<br>No
<br>Come on. There has to be something I can do.
<br>-see power of certain words. 
<br>-no's were clear and direct. A gateway to final yes
<br>
<br>"No" is rarely a final answer. Think of negotiations with a kid.
<br>We conditioned ourdelves to fear of that
<br>Say it to protect yourself (status quo) and consider possibilities
<br>
<br>You preserve people's authonomy by No.
<br>Hostage taker - start talking instead of demanding to surrender. Will finish quicker
<br>
<br>NO means
<br>-not ready to agree
<br>-you make me feel uncomfortable
<br>-i don't understand, can't afford
<br>-want something else
<br>-need more info
<br>#
<br>
<br>After no: "what about that doesn't work for you? What would you need to make it work? It seems there is something that bothers you"
<br>#
<br>
<br>YES types
<br>Counterfeit - easier escape route
<br>Commitment - yes you want to hear, let's sign contract
<br>
<br>Your job is not to get them say small yes
<br>But to get them discover their goal as their own
<br>
<br>Creating connection is useful but is useless unless they feel they are equally (or solely) responsible for connection and the new ideas
<br>
<br>We cannot control others decisions
<br>But we can influence them by seeing and hearing exactly what they want. Entering their mental world
<br>#
<br>
<br>-primary urges: need feeling of safety and control
<br>(You cannot logically convince they are safe) - being nice is unsuccessful (sympathy)
<br>
<br>We live in an age which celebrates niceness under various names
<br>
<br>Yes is sign of defense"do you have a minute to talk?" > "Is it a bad time to talk now?"
<br>No tells you counterpart is engaged and thinking
<br>#
<br>
<br>No can push to decision making zone.
<br>Many think No means end of discussion. Use it strategically and it opens path forward
<br>
<br>Say no and you will see opportunitities you didn't previously.
<br>No often Spurs people to action. They thought they protected themselves and it's time to slip away
<br>
<br>Political fundraising
<br>-dont you think gas prices are high? Is obama responsible for that? Can I have your card number to make a change?
<br>VS
<br>-if things stay the same do you think the best days are ahead of us? Are you going to sit and do nothing? If you want to do something today you can donate to x
<br>-wants put you to in-charge position
<br>-notoce how NOs are swapped by Yes
<br>
<br>Every no gets me closer to yes
<br>
<br>MISLABEL
<br>Technique to get their prompt response
<br>Use wrong label even if you know it's wrong, that forces them to correct you
<br>-sounds it seems you are eager to leave this job
<br>-if you are not interested, I understand
<br>###
<br>CS
<br>
<br>If you are feared of No. You cannot negotiate
<br>
<br>Get them to say No to become comfortable to move forward.
<br>Force to say no
<br>-"lets talk about what you don't want"
<br>-"ok, what you would say no to"
<br>##
<br>
<br>3rd Follow-up - one sentence email
<br>-"Have you given up on this project?"
<br>##
<br>Request to define their position and explain to you
<br>You give threat you will walk away with your terms
<br>
<br>As a parent you say: ok, I am leaving.
<br>Apply to the business as well - may sound rude, get over it. Ignoring you is what's rude
<br>
<br>Sounds contrary, but you cannot get them feel safe and in control by being nice. Need to get them draw boundaries by saying no.
<br>Yes doesnt tell their true feelings
<br>
<br>Negotiation is about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you.
<br>
<br>Psychology - Carl Rogerd - change can only come if therapist accepts client as he or she is
<br>
<br>-we developed habit of hiding who we are, what we think and instead seek approval
<br>
<br>Give them label with confidence (unverified)
<br>To get them open their position
<br>"You hate them, do you?"
<br>--
<br>-give feelings names and identify how they feel
<br>#
<br>
<br>I didn't know what it was going to give us. I knew we had to trust the process
<br>
<br>1.Silence - use for emphasis, get them keep talking until emotions are drained from dialogue
<br>2.Minimal encouragements - yes, ok, I see - shows you listen
<br>--
<br>3.Mirroring - rather than argue, repeat what they say
<br>##
<br>
<br>4.Paraphrase - repeat in your own words. Shows you understand
<br>5.summarize - repeat and acknowledge emotions
<br>
<br>Mirror, encourage, label - repeat and gets them soften
<br>
<br>Get them to say Thats right
<br>-you need to show empathy, get trust, reflect on their vision
<br>-works on hostage negotiations (not talking about ransom any more) and business
<br>
<br>Label true root cause(football)
<br>-You think it's not masculine.
<br>-You think it's cowardly to get out
<br>
<br>Put onderstandong of their needs to work for you
<br>-dont talk about benefits of your product, talk about thier work. Start with things they are passionate about
<br>--last time we spoke about your patients. I remember you seemed very passionate about treating them and tailoring treatment. You seem to have deep understanding... summarize, discuss challenges - understand how your product fits, build trust
<br>You tailor for each patient, reflect on challenges
<br>
<br>Negotiation is never a linear formula
<br>Do X, get Y - the only way to achieve Y
<br>Pay this amount of money, get this
<br>Understand the world of unspoken needs and thoughts, you can change their needs and expectations(eg people's fear of deadlines).
<br>There are always ways to bend their reality to conform what you want, not what they thought they deserve.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Compromise won't work for someone with win-lose approch
<br>Don't settle with compromise - it's a bad deal and no deal is often better then bad deal
<br>(BlowimgNose - compromise of patched A and B worse than A or B)
<br>-
<br>We do compromises because it's easy and saves us face. Most people are driven by fear of causing pain.
<br>-
<br>Creative solutions are harder, cause risk and conflict. Great deals are made of hard stuff. Embrace the hard stuff. That's what great negotiators do
<br>#
<br>
<br>Set deadlines - real or fictional - to create pressure - deal now is better than good deal. 
<br>Deadlines - Get people say things impulsively against their interests (loss, consequences)
<br>
<br>Deadlines are always flexible and arbitrary, hardly trigger consequences
<br>
<br>More ambiguous threat (answered What, When, Why, How), less serious
<br>
<br>Understand their motivation
<br>-kidnapper wants random by Friday because wants to party
<br>-car dealer may accept a better price by the end of the month when transactions are assessed and needstohit his targets.
<br>
<br>Advice from great negotiators
<br>-keep your deadlines in secret? No, use it to your advantage. They many put you under pressure, but you may give them no deal
<br>-use your deadline to create pressure on them. Deadlines are never arbitrary
<br>#
<br>
<br>If you create your startegy on assumption the other guy thinks like you, it's not empathy, it's projection
<br>###
<br>
<br>Have 10 dollars, negotiate with counterpart fair split. If turns down you offer, I take my dollars back
<br>-the most rational offer is to give 1 dollar - logically unrejetable - 1 is always better than 0
<br>-any other deal is an emotional offer
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>That's ok.
<br>Why we use logic to reason, our decisions are actually governed by emotions
<br>--
<br>People with damage of part of brain that generates emotions cannot make even simplest decisions, however they can describe what they should do in logical terms
<br>
<br>Ultimatum game- most people reject unfair offers.
<br>Negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs monetary gains
<br>
<br>People, companies and countries do that - to reject perceived unfairness
<br>
<br>Take advantage - say "We just want what's fair"
<br>-get better price offer, - takes counterpart to defence
<br>-"We have given you a fair offer" - aggressively shift focus on counterparts lack of understanding of fairness
<br>-"Fair? It seems you are ready to provide evidence to support that"
<br>##
<br>
<br>Set stage for empathy
<br>"I want to treat you fairly at all the times. Stop me when you feel you are treated unfairly" -gets them honest and builds your good reputation
<br>
<br>Know emotional drivers and frame  benefits in language that resonates
<br>-babysitter sells calm evening, locksmith security, estate agent cozy living
<br>
<br>See mental patterns and you will be able to influence them.
<br>You can see them in irrational decisions
<br>Value is what we perceive --if I sell you a coffee mug worth of 1usd for 5, you would resell for 7. Deal for 10 would have less value than potential deal for 20 instead.
<br>
<br>Find more on 
<br>prospect theory-how people choose between options that involve risk and negotiation. 
<br>-
<br>Certainty Effect - People are drawn to sure things even when probability is a Better choice
<br>#
<br>
<br>Loss Aversion - People will take risks to avoid losses than achieve same gains (why people buy insurance they don't need)
<br>^^
<br>To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

<br>NEEED to change perception of value
<br>Needed to tell contractor that I can only pay 500 instead of 2000

<br>//Now the call is not about 2000, but not losing 500 to some other guide
<br>##
<br>
<br>Domt screw up your price negotiation (salary) by going first
<br>-its normal that err were have perfect info and know little about the market to open with confidence
<br>
<br>GIVE RANGE
<br>Instead of saying I am worth of 110k say At places like X people get 130-170
<br>-albeit the best possible ballpark you wish to be in
<br>-gets them thinking in higher levels
<br>-when asked on salary, give range - more likely to get more
<br>-domt stop there, make sure you negotiated terms for your next raise
<br>###
<br>
<br>Pivot to nonmonetary values
<br>They ask you How much. Numbers in isolation lead to bargaining
<br>If you anchored high, Offer them things that are not important to you but may be important to them. If their offer is low, ask for things important to them
<br>
<br>ˇ-when asked How much? Move focus to non-financial issues
<br>Talk about your value - sell yourself more than workforce. Offer leadership
<br>Ask "What does it take to be successful here?"
<br>#
<br>-asked for guidance, they will watch how you follow advice
<br>Make a their personal stake in your success
<br>-you need to be good in labeling their emotions for that and empathising
<br>
<br>Use odd numbers - seem more fixed. Give weight of thoughtful ca´culation
<br>Zeros look like placeholders
<br>Decimal nuˇbers seem as calculated
<br>Give range as 113.5-125
<br>Get your number - don't say yes. Keep taking and create empathy
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>Use reciprocity
<br>When they reject your proposal, offer a generous surprise gift
<br>
<br>Bend reality
<br>-anchor their starting point. Tell how bad it would be
<br>Get them see what they would lose rather presenting potential gain
<br>
<br>Negotiation is not a wrestling match to exhaust your opponent
<br>#
<br>
<br>Failures plant seeds for future succcess
<br>
<br>Best negotiation is to get your counterpart do the yworknfor you and suggest the best solution
<br>"WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE?"
<br>
<br>We failed because we wanted them to see things our way
<br>We failed because we feared of rejection if we asked on information we needed
<br>We asked close-ended questions: yes/no, I want you do X - rather tell what you need, the guy isn't following your orders, he thinks it's his idea - you ask them for help
<br>
<br>
<br>Try it no negotiate price at store: instead of what you need describe what you are looking for and ask for suggestions
<br>Give them co tell rather than create pressure
<br>"Price is a bit more than I budgeted..how am I supposed to do that?"
<br>#
<br>
<br>Unresolved imvoice
<br>-summarize situation, then ask How am I supposed to do that?
<br>Stay calm - they will see it as a problem to solve, not a threat
<br>-without accusing them of anything, get them understand your problem and push to solve
<br>--turm close ended question to open ended
<br>#
<br>
<br>Softening words
<br>Perhaps
<br>Maybe
<br>It seems
<br>I think
<br>-takes out aggression from your statement
<br>
<br>Focus on WHAT and HOW
<br>Sometimes WHY
<br>Nothing else. WHO, When, Where prompts to share fact without thinking
<br>WHY  backfired
<br>Can, Is, Are, Do lead to yesno questions
<br>
<br>Does this look like something you would like?
<br>>
<br>How does it look to you?
<br>#
<br>
<br>What about this does work for you?
<br>>
<br>What about this doesn't work for you?
<br>-to trigger useful info
<br>
<br>What is the biggest challenge to you?
<br>
<br>>What about this is important to you?
<br>How can I help to make it better for us?
<br>How would you like me to proceed?
<br>How can we solve this problem?
<br>What's the objective? What are we trying to accomplish?
<br>How am I supposed to do that?
<br>#
<br>
<br>You can't leave
<br>>
<br>I understand you are pissed off
<br>What do you hope to solve by leaving? (Guide toward solving the problem)
<br>
<br>Boss showing his power questioning previous approval
<br>-When you signed this, what did you have in mind?
<br>
<br>Self control
<br>-if you can't control your emotions how do you expect to influence emotions of someone else?
<br>
<br>That's right question > It seems my bill is not justified, not fair
<br>How does this bill violate our agreement?
<br>
<br>When you are verbally insulted, don't strike back - disarm opponent by calibrated question (open ended, what, how - or offer apology - you are right, that was a bit harsh)
<br>Calm down emotions - that's how solutions can be found
<br>
<br>Don't try to force your opponent to admit you are right. Aggressive confrontation . Don't confuse with constructive dialogue
<br>
<br>---
<br>HOW TO implement the agreement
<br>
<br>Tjˇhr business grew as tourists felt their obvious passion
<br>
<br>I wanted to employ lessons we learned
<br>I told my guys we have a new strategy
<br>
<br>To make it harder for rebels to kill - hostage impressed them with his knowledge of jungle anfˇd reached martial arts
<br>
<br>Answer each demand with question
<br>>How do I ...?
<br>I don't have that much money. How can I raise? Always questions...
<br>-answering questions gives them position of control
<br>-giide opponent to develop solution that works for you
<br>-you don't say No. You say How which accepts the demand and drills down - shows respect
<br>##
<br>
<br>>I would love to help. But how am I supposed to do that?
<br>
<br>People put more effort to implement solution if they t hink it's theird
<br>
<br>Assure implementatiomˇn
<br>>How do we assure we are on track?
<br>>What do we do if we find we are off track?
<br>Then summarize their answers until you get Thats right
<br>
<br>Warning sign they don't believe idea is theitˇrs
<br>FAˇake yes, you are right
<br>I'll try
<br>?investigate problem
<br>Get them tell their terms - keep asking how
<br>
<br>Consider oˇinterests of people not directly involved biˇut responsible for implementation
<br>
<br>>How does this affect rest of the team?
<br>What they see as main challenge?
<br>How aligned are they?
<br>How does this affect everybody else?
<br>
<br>Someone (a stakeholder) may kill the deal because may feel  their ego is hurt
<br>
<br>How can I is a polite way to say the offer is generous, bit doesn't work for me
<br>Deliver it in polite way to become a request for help
<br>You can say Im sorry to soften your No
<br>"I'm sorry Im afraid I just can't do that"
<br>
<br>When you say NO, use downward inflection and tone of regard- it's not meant to be "no!"
<br>
<br>Multistep NO
<br>Say NO for four times to get things changed - get them bid against themselves
<br>
<br>Treating JERKS - aggresivity
<br>-how do I, how can I? How am I supposed? - gives silent no
<br>-responding with defence,what and how questions
<br>
<br>7percemt of message comes from words.
<br>38 percent comes from tone of voice
<br>55 from body language 
<br>(UCLA)
<br>
<br>Pay close attention to words and presemtation - if don't align, suspect is probably lying or unconvinced
<br>-Sounds, are we agreed?
<br>-Yes...
<br>-You said yes, but there is hesitation
<br>-nah, it's necessary thing really
<br>-No, this is important, let's make sure we get this right
<br>#
<br>
<br>People who live try harder to be believed - use more words, more complex sentences
<br>
<br>Slicky sales people use your name to hammer you.
<br>Use your name or names of involved people - forces ampathy, humanizes objects
<br>
<br>I gravitate towards tense situations
<br>
<br>Introduce your name to get counterpart warmer
<br>-dont sit here
<br>-hey, my name is Chris, offer hand for handshake (may stop seing you as enemy - maybe guy is on low point and world is against him)
<br>
<br>Shop:
<br>-can I have discount?
<br>-no
<br>-my name is Chris... Explain your situation...
<br>Humanize yourself, use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in fun and friendly way.let tjem enjoy interaction

<br>
<br>Started huge argument and soured their relationship
<br>
<br>Strategy to build empathy
<br>-It seems...you are under pressure from wife..I understand ... It takes a lot froˇ you
<br>-list out all concerns..I know you think I ...don't care about costs and taking profits from company : be careless with spending 
<br>
<br>This price is very fair...
<br>Away to put off someone is implying that disagreeing you is unfair
<br>
<br>Demand from lawyer, reply with polite NO:
<br>/The price you offered is very fair, and I certainly wish that I could afford it. Bruno has worked very hard for this business, and he deserves to be compensated appropriately. I am very sorry, but wish you the best of luck./
<br>--
<br>/Thank you for your offer. You were generous to reduce the price, which I greatly appreciate. I really wish that I could pay you this amount, but I am sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this time. As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with that type of money. Again, I wish you the best of luck./
<br>-resist temptation to accept a better offer
<br>/Thank you again for the generous offer. You have really come down on the price and I have tried very hard to come up with that amount. Unfortunately, no one is willing to lend me the money, not even my mother. I have tried various avenues but cannot come up with the funding. In the end, I can offer you €23,567, although I can only pay €15,321.37 up front. I could pay you the remainder over a one-year period, but that is really the most I can do. I wish you the best in your decision./
<br>
<br>YES is nothing without HOW. To know how, ask HOW - gives them feeling control discussion
<br>Ask How can I do that - as subtle no that pushes them to look for other solutions
<br>
<br>A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you’re hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.
<br>
<br>36k. Give understanding nod and purse lips. In nicest way possible
<br>/“I can pay $30,000,” I said. “And I can pay it up front, all cash. I’ll write a check today for the full amount. I’m sorry, I’m afraid I just can’t pay any more.”/
<br>--I'm sorry, we can't do that. I hope you understand, we can figure out something with financing 36k
<br>--It's a beautiful truck. Really amazing. I can't tell you how much I want it and I *know its worth more than I am offering.* I'm sorry, this is embarrassing. *I can't do that price*
<br>34k
<br>This is very generous and it's the car of my dreams. I *really wish I could do that.* *I simply cant*
<br>32.5 - this is your win!
<br>I am so grateful. You have been generous and I can't thank you enough. Truck is worth more than my price. I aˇ sorry, just can't do that
<br>No smile, stood up, gone. We can do that. 30k

BARGAINING<br>
More than offers and counteroffers. Recognize psychological strategies that play vital role<br>
<br>
You are uncovering a riptide - identify psychological forces...use them somewhere more productive<br>
More productive...<br>
Yes. To a place where we can...<br>
-mirroring. You can play with someone to get engaged for hour<br>
-psychological tool that works well with assertive guys<br>
<br>
ANALYST Analysts are methodical and diligent. They are not in a big rush. Instead, they believe that as long as they are working toward the best result in a thorough and systematic way, time is of little consequence. Their self-image is linked to minimizing mistakes. Their motto: As much time as it takes to get it right.<br>
reserved problem solvers, and information aggregators,<br>
They will give you a piece, but if they don’t get a piece in return within a certain period of time, they lose trust and will disengage.<br>
People like this are skeptical by nature.€€<br>
Asking questions on beginning - they’re not going to want to answer until they understand all the implications.<br>
Silence to them is an opportunity to think.If you feel they don’t see things the way you do, give them a chance to think first.<br>
They are not quick to answer calibrated questions, or closed-ended questions when the answer is “Yes.” They may need a few days to respond.<br>
If you are analyst *biggest thing you can do when you speak is smile*<br>
Smiling can also become a habit that makes it easy for you to mask any moments you’ve been caught off guard.<br>
Separate people and problem - resistant to reciprocity, friendliness<br>
Time is preparation, silence is time to think<br>
<br>
ACCOMODATOR Accommodators think as long as there is a free-flowing continuous exchange of information time is being well spent. As long as they’re communicating, they’re happy.<br>
They are very easy to talk to, extremely friendly, and have pleasant voices.<br>
If they’re your counterpart, be sociable and friendly. Listen to them talk about their ideas and use calibrated questions focused specifically on implementation to nudge them along and find ways to translate their talk into action.<br>
They want to get to know you first<br>
Great use of chitchat<br>
Builds relationship<br>
<br>
ASSERTIVE Their self-image is linked to how many things they can get accomplished in a period of time. Perfection not as important as getting done<br>
Have aggressive communication style a d don't worry about future interactions<br>
Care their own goals more than people<br>
Want to be heard. Don't listen as long as they know they are heard<br>
Use mirrors and calibrated questions to them. Get them say that's right<br>
Reciprocity - give inch get mile - always expect something in return - they will look for opportunity to make more<br>
Tone - may sound unintentionally harsh<br>
Less approachable<br>
Use silence to speak more<br>
<br>
See the world from their side<br>
<br>
If you think that world looks same for other as to you, they you will project yourself on others what makes damaging assumptions<br>
Understand people are different, increase your success rate<br>
<br>
Start negotiation with punch that hurts<br>
<br>
Experiemced negotiators don't start looking for compromise. That start with ridiculous, an extreme offer<br>
If you a re e not prepared for that you'll lose your moorings and go to your maximum immediately<br>
#<br>
-other side doesn't know it's an extreme offer<br>
-freaks out this is standard to get deal done<br>
<br>
Mike Tyson: everybody has a plan until they are punched in the mouth<br>
<br>
Start with giving polite NO: "How am I supposed to do that?"<br>
Or deflect anchor: "What are we trying to accomplish?"<br>
#<br>
-refocus counterpart pushing you to compromise<br>
<br>
If you get punch-in-face<br>
-pivot to your terms: no monetary issues that make final price work<br>
Encouraging voice<br>
"Let's put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal"<br>
"What else would you be offer to make a good price for me?"<br>
#<br>
<br>
If they say ok and push you to go first:<br>
Instead of naming price, allude to incredibly high number someone would charge<br>
"If you go to X, they will charge you..."<br>
#<br>
<br>
Learn to make punch first, or you get punched<br>
<br>
Don't fold after being punched. Things don't go always according to plan. Asking for 600. Talking how students liked trip and how much it would mean<br>
-money is tight and I can authorize only 300<br>
-thats generous offer given your limits, but I don't know how it would help usto achieve a great reception for alumnis. We need 1000 (give extreme anchor)<br>
-this is out of my range but I give you 500 (don't stop here, but it may get hard)<br>
-850 would work<br>
-im already giving you more than enough, 500 is reasonable (be ready for punches, talk about non monetary stuff)<br>
-i want these money for great event for school. How about 775? You are my last stop<br>
(Be sincere and tell how much you want)<br>
(Ok to repeat your request, reasoning or question)<br>
<br>
Learn to punch - sometimes situation calls you to be aggressive<br>
Only way to change counterparts rigid mindset<br>
<br>
Showing anger increase chances of successful negotiation - shows passion that makes counterpartto accept less<br>
Fake anger destroys trust - keep it under comtrol<br>
"I don't see this working" "how this would ever work"<br>
Use as a tool for extreme situations<br>
It's always better to say "Im sorry this just doesn't work for me"<br>
<br>
USING WHY<br>
A. Get counterpart to defense - "why would you do that?"<br>
B. Reinforces counterpart on your side - "why would you choose me? Your existing partners are great!"<br>
<br>
USING I<br>
Take focus on you - gives you time to make your point<br>
"I'm sorry, this doesn't work for me"<br>
"I feel...when you...because..."<br>
<br>
If you feel you can't say no, then you are hostage<br>
##<br>
-<br>
No deal is better than bad deal<br>
Be clear on you bottom line. Never be needy for deal<br>
<br>
You need to respond / or express bottom line with empathetic and limitsettimg boundaries to maintain collaborative relationship<br>
#<br>
<br>
Never see counterpart as enemy. Person is not a problem. The issue is. Focus on issue<br>
<br>
Our culture demonizes people - remove the person, problem is resolved<br>
<br>
Punch as last resort - always try to deescalate situation. Suggest time break - counterpart won't feel as hostage of the situation<br>
Never create an enemy<br>
<br>
Powerful tools<br>
Calibrated questions - what, how<br>
Mirrors, labels<br>
<br>
Pay or we'll kill situation<br>
-no room for discussion. Use Ackerman system, siutable for any situation (business deal, price negotiation - we cannot do anything more)<br>
<br>
1 set your target price and start your offer on 65pervent of target<br>
-gives a slap that pushes them to their limit. The shock creates a fear of loss. Pushes them to raise<br>
2 calculate three raises - 85, 95, 100<br>
-this is counteroffer to their offer - makes them bid against themselves<br>
3 be prepared to say NO in many polite ways before you increase offer<br>
4 use precise and no round numbers, on your final number offer nonmonetary item they probably don't want - it shows you are on your limit<br>
##<br>
<br>
Haiti<br>
Punch with extreme anchor and keep hitting with calibrated questions<br>
<br>
Asking for 4751 dollars. One dollar sounds ridiculous but there is difference.<br>
You can by nothing for 2 USD,but there is plenty of things for 1.99<br>
<br>
*You need to give strong resistance - this won't move you.*<br>
*Let them feel you are tough case to say no.*<br>
<br>
Rent negotiation after receiving notice of increase<br>
-luke the place, comparable offers not as good<br>
-lay down situation: positive experiemce in the building, leats pay on time. Would be sad for me to leave and sad for landlord to lose a good tenant<br>
*Buildings around neighbourhood offer MUCH LOWER price*s - not true but *indirectly tells I already pay too much*<br>
Even if your building is better in terms of location and serviced´s, how am I supposed to pay 200 extra?<br>
--agent: price is still good and we charge premium<br>
I understand you have better location and amenities, but I cant. *Would 1730 a month for a year lease sound fair to you?*<br>
Agent launged, don't get pulled into a haggle. Ask how they price renewals - turned out leaving would open risk of unrented appartment - one month would be 2000 loss<br>
You need to improvise. You need to feel control of negotiation. You can give 2 or 3 offers - don't let rules ruin flow.<br>
Let me try and move along with you - how about 1790?<br>
Your number is very low. *Give me time to think this out* - any response that is not outright rejecyˇtion means you have edge<br>
<br>
*Say NO to any offer.* Once they start withdrawing, it gives them push<br>
-thats generous from you, but how can I accept if I can live for 1800 a few blocks away? 150 a month means a lot to me. It seems you would rather *run the risk of keeping the place unrented*.<br>
-its not that. I can't go lower<br>
*Make dramatic pause*: ok, I will tell you. I initially went up from 1730 to 1790.  (Sigh) I will bring it up to 1810. Hope this works for both (still ridiculous, say with all respect. Gives punch)<br>
Still low - ok, give me your last offer<br>
<br>
How to negotiate discount- decrease their offers, no round numbers, deep redearch, smart labelling, polite No.<br>
<br>
*You need to create conflict* <br>
To successfully negotiate<br>
Sometimes it's path to great deals<br>
Find a way to have fun out of it - conflict brings out truth, creativity and resolution<br>
<br>
Prepare - *WORK BACKWARDS*<br>
Set ambitious but legitimate goal<br>
Prepare labels, questions, answers - you don't need to improvise<br>
-prepare to give punch. Or you will get knocked off by ambitious anchor<br>
Prepare tactics to avoid getting stuck at compromise trap<br>
-determines boundaries and learn to give punch without anger. The guy is not the problem, the situation is<br>
-prepare Ackerman Plan: 65, 85, 95, 100<br>
<br>
Back swan<br>
-refers to impossible things. Until 17th century all swans were white<br>
-things happen that were thought impossible<br>
<br>
All hostage takers wanted the same - money, respect, helicopter<br>
<br>
Internet, 911, financial crisis - none of these were predicted. Markers were there, but people didn't pay attention <br>
<br>
Predictions based on previous experiences are useless <br>
-because you didn't see back swan, it doesn't mean I doesn't exist<br>
<br>
In negotiation there is<br>
-what you know<br>
-known unknowns<br>
-unknown unknowns - these may be game changers if uncovered. However, no one may realise them<br>
<br>
To uncover unknown unknowns<br>
-retain beginners mind<br>
-forget what you know (you'd think you know enough - why would I need to know this?)<br>
<br>
Set hypothesis, that each negotiation has 3 Black swan which would change everything<br>
<br>
Finding black swans changes the game<br>
-*from one-directional move-countermove game*<br>
*-tomorrow 3d game that's emotional, adaptive, intuitove*<br>
<br>
You need to change your mindset<br>
Open up established pathways<br>
Embrace more intuitive and nuanced ways of listening<br>
<br>
What you don't know may kill your deal - negotiation, work, personal<br>
People aren't able to articulate what they need. World didn't tell Steve Jobs it needs an iPhone. He saw need<br>
<br>
Conventional questions confirm known knowns. They don't dig to the unknown<br>
<br>
To uncover unknowns<br>
-intensively listen, ask a lot of questioms<br>
-*read nonverbal clues and always voice your observations with counterpart*<br>
#<br>
<br>
-you have to feel truth behind camouflage, note sˇall pauses that suggest discomfort or lies<br>
#<br>
<br>
Don't look to verify what you expect. If you do, that's what you'll find<br>
Open yourself up to factual reality that's in front of you.<br>
<br>
Negotion is walking on tightrope<br>
Focus on end goal will distract you.<br>
Concentrate on your next step. Once you make all the steps, you'll be in the end<br>
<br>
People think black swans are highly proprietary or closely guarded info's.<br>
Other side may be completely oblivious - nedbanlivý<br>
They always have pieces their value they don't understand<br>
<br>
Leverage - inflict loss and withhold gain<br>
<br>
Where does your counterpart want to gain and there they are feared to lose?<br>
#<br>
<br>
Find it and build leverage over counterparts notions and perceptions<br>
In reality, it doesn't matter wj´hat leverage exists against you, what matters it what leverage they think they think you have on them - it's essentially emotional concept that can be manufactured whether it exists or not<br>
If they are talking to you, you have leverage.<br>
<br>
Would you say that in hostage negatiation kidnapper has leverage?<br>
They have something you love but you have something g they list for - see it from their side *where power is*.<br>
*How many buyers they have for commodity that are trying to sell?*<br>
#<br>
What business is successful of there is only one buyer?<br>
<br>
Leverage has a lot of inputs, like time and necessity and competition. If you need to sell your house now, you have less leverage than if you don’t have a deadline. If you want to sell it but don’t have to, you have more. And if various people are bidding on it at once, good on you.<br>
<br>
leverage is as a fluid that sloshes between the parties. As a negotiator you should always be aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have the most to lose if negotiations collapse. The party *who feels they have more to lose and are the most afraid of that loss has less leverag*e, and vice versa. To get leverage, you have to *persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose* if the deal falls through.<br>
<br>
Positive leverage<br>
When they say I want it. I want to buy<br>
You have *powerful* to give it to them<br>
You can make their desire come true, withhold it and inflict pain, use their desire fp´or a better deal with another party<br>
--<br>
Get an offer to sell business - so low it's insulting<br>
Activate casual contacts with other buyers to start bidding war. *At least you force them To make a choice* - CS would do<br>
Don't rush with answers. Y*ou control what they want.* Experienced negotiator delays offers, don't want to give up leverage<br>
You have gone from from where you want something to *where you both want something from each other*<br>
Identify their wants<br>
-want to buy company over time - help him to do that, if he increase price<br>
-maybe he cannot give more. Help him what he wants - but sell only 75percent of the business<br>
<br>
Eagle doesn't fight a snake on ground.<br>
It picks it up into the sky and changes the battleground. Then releases it. Snake in the air is weak and vulnerable,unlike on the ground<br>
<br>
Life advice<br>
Don't let simple things be complex<br>
-find right partner so relationship isn't a nightmare<br>
-find work that gets you excited every day<br>
<br>
Refuse to accept complexity.<br>
People will argue your company is different and more complex than others. Refuse this<br>
Apple, Nike - you can change the world, build important companies, market great products with 40-140 characters<br>
<br>
People will rather solve B problems than A problems<br>
B problems are problems we know and they keep usin our comfort zone<br>
A problems are high impact problems. <br>
*If entire company focuses on B problems this prevents growth*<br>
-fimd what they want and what you can give them<br>
<br>
Negative leverage<br>
If you don't do x, I will damage your reputation - gets attention due to loss aversion - potential loses are bigger than similar gains, stronger motivation to save reputation from destruction<br>
-pushing too much may lead to ignorance of the threat or acting irrationally<br>
-try softer way: label negative leverage and make it clear without attacking<br>
--*It seems you have strongly valued the fact that you have always paid on time*<br>
--*it seems you don't care in what position you are leaving me in*<br>
-highlight negative root cause, not the consequence to get their action<br>
<br>
Normative leverage<br>
Everyone has moral standards, use them to leverage your position<br>
*You have leverage if you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and actions*<br>
Know their values - uncover black swans<br>
<br>
<br>
Understand first<br>
<br>
In sense negotiation its not how well speak, but how well you listen that determines your success<br>
<br>
Understanding is precondition to be persuasive and develop opinions that resonate<br>
<br>
Uncover black swans - very often worldview, religion<br>
<br>
Understand this before speaking rationally- rather to get them say YES if you want be influential<br>
<br>
Hostage negotiation - does their vision of future incˇvolve them living?<br>
<br>
Paradocˇx of power<br>
The harder you push, the more resistance you get<br>
<br>
You get attention and results<br>
When you show respect - show you hear, understand the worldview<br>
Review we what you hear<br>
<br>
Similarity<br>
Trigger them to realise they see things in the same way<br>
That's right moment - we tend to trust more<br>
<br>
Show you understand their deep reasons<br>
<br>
Every engineer, every executive, every child—*all of us want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary.*<br>
<br>
-recognise and address their belief<br>
- Give a purposeful plan to get there<br>

Ted Leonsis is great at this. As the owner of the Washington Wizards professional basketball team and the Washington Capitals professional hockey team, he is always talking about creating the immortal moments in sports that people will tell their grandchildren about. Who doesn’t want to come to an agreement with someone who is going to make them immortal?<br>
<br>
BECAUSE Request<br>
People more likely do favors if you *give them Because...*<br>
-research 90 vs 60: ask to skip line at photocopy - I *have 5 pages. can I cut in line BECAUSE I have to make copies* - you didn't say anything groundbreaking and this works fine <br>
<br>
I know understanding such things is the best way to discover the other side’s vulnerabilities and wants and thereby gain influence.<br>
<br>
When other say Thats crazy/Doesnt make sense - that's a perfect opportunity to discover black swans.<br>
Refusing drill deeper is human nature to embrace unknown. It scares us<br>
<br>
People who operate with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different<br>
ExEmployee threatening lawsuit for unpaid commission 130k<br>
They found mess in their system and it's only 25k. Offered to pay 25k if drops lwsuit<br>
Exemployee says he's going forward with laysuit, acted irrationally, crazy<br>
Malhotra told *problem is is not craziness, but lack of information and trust*<br>
Made and audit and sent him results - he dropped the lawsuit<br>

“You got to get him to dinner. You’re going to say, ‘/Would it be a bad idea for me to take you to your favorite steak house and we just have a few laughs, and we don’t talk business?/’”<br>
-<br>
But there was no way not to talk about it, and just because my client created personal, face-to-face interaction, the contact admitted he was the wrong guy.<br>
<br>
Discover black swans:<br>
-Pay close attention to breaks in communication, anything that interrupts the flow<br>
-moments before meeting is wrapped up, and when people are leaving can unˇcover a gold mine. Never turn off your recording<br>

“It looks like an interesting property,” he said. “Unfortunately, we don’t know the market fundamentals. We like downtown and King Street in particular, but we have a lot of questions.”<br>
*How and What -* how has Charleston been affected by the economic downturn?”<br>
“It sounds like I’m in good hands!” - *build Empathy*<br>
“If he or she is selling such a cash cow, it seems like the seller must have doubts about future market fundamentals,” he said. - mislabelled, but broker corrected and showed black swan - seller needs cash for other mortages<br>
*Counteroffer* - I think I have heard enough,” he said. “We are willing to offer $3.4 million.”<br>
We cannot go more than 3.55 - rather Use label or calibrated question to get broker bid against himself - <br>

People generally fear conflict,<br>
Obercome fear<br>
LEARNING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE<br>
<br>
People in close relationships often avoid making their own interests known and instead compromise across<br>
<br>
Are we really afraid of the guy across the table?<br>
<br>
our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe.<br>
It's not the guy who scares us - it's the conflict<br>
<br>
-navigate it with empathy. If you’re going to be great at anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband,-you have to<br>
<br>
honest conflict between *people over their goals actually helps energize the problem-solving process* in a collaborative way. <br>
<br>
Skilled negotiators have a talent for using conflict to keep the negotiation going without stumbling into a personal battle.<br>
<br>
pushing hard for what you believe is not selfish. It is not bullying.<br>
It's helping you<br>
<br>
When you ask calibrated questions, yes, you are leading your counterpart to your goals. But you are also leading them to examine and articulate what they want and why and how they can achieve it. You are demanding creativity of them, and therefore pushing them toward a collaborative solution.<br>
<br>
Whether in office or at home<br>
*don’t avoid honest, clear conflict.*<br>
It will get back to you as better job, higher salary or happy family<br>
<br>
Negotiate a better price<br>
Besides making a win for you<br>
Think how to make win for them. They won't like your offer but you help them reach their sales quota and for sure will pay more than their costs<br>
If you cared about your win selfishly - you can steal it<br>
<br>
Remember to leverage multipliers - positive (give what they want), negative (hurt) and normative (using their norms to bring around)<br>
<br>
When someone acts irrationally and crazy, they most likely are not - figure out why - search for constraints, desires, bad info<br>
<br>
Never underestimate the power of extracting info from face - keep looking for 10 mins, don't stop<br>

<br>
Make a list of negotiation tools you are using<br>
<br>
People have limited focus in complex and stressful situations, like negotiation<br>
We gravitate towards focus point that has biggest psychological significance<br>
-even if we win negotiation but end up with mediocre results<br>
<br>
I tell my clients that as part of their preparation they should think about the outcome extremes: best and worst. If you’ve got both ends covered, you’ll be ready for anything.<br>
-*know what you cannot accept*<br>
<br>
Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don’t set goals or simply strive to do their best.<br>
-*people who expect and (articulate it) more get more*<br>
-determines high end goal<br>
<br>
Good practice - discuss your goal with friend or colleague before taking it to negotiation<br>
<br>
Tactical empathy validation<br>
-when they say *that's right*<br>
<br>
--shated with developing common ground<br>
--dont ask how is it different. Ask what does it have in common?<br>
Ms<br>

*Labeling*<br>
Prepare list of any accusations they may have no matter how unfair or ridiculous they may be<br>
/Universal labels/<br>
/It seems like _________ is valuable to you. <br>
It seems like you don’t like _________. <br>
It seems like you value __________. <br>
It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you’re reluctant to _________./<br>
<br>
/It seems like ... Is important/<br>
/It seems you are worried about this./<br>
<br>
To Landlord: “It seems like you want stability with your tenants.”<br>
<br>
*Calibrated questions*<br>
-look at their past positions - what are their demands<br>
*Motivations - what worries them, what they hope for*<br>
<br>
*Most of us assume the needs of others conflict with ours*<br>
<br>
We tend to limit our vision only to our problems. Forget that others tˇhave problems too<br>
<br>
JK Rowling<br>
“/You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it’s whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.”/<br>
<br>
/What are we trying to accomplish?/<br>
/How does this fit into what the objective is?/<br>
/What’s the core issue here?/<br>
<br>
Consider others<br>
When decision is made in comittee<br>
Or<br>
Decision will affect other people<br>
Change may make them look as if they haven’t been doing their job. Your dilemma in such a negotiation is how to make them *look good in the face of that change.*<br>
*self-esteem, status, autonomy*, and other nonfinancial needs. Think about their perceived losses.<br>
<br>
/For example, the guy across the table may be hesitating to install the new accounting system he needs (and you are selling) because he doesn’t want to screw anything up before his annual review in four months’ time. Instead of lowering your price, you can offer to help impress his boss, and do it safely, by promising to finish the installation in ninety days, guaranteed./<br>
<br>
/What are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? How does making a deal with us affect things? What happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you?/<br>
