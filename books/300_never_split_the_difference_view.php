<br>* application of game theory and empathy/emotional design
<br>##
<br>
<br>Use empathy, not because you're a nice guy but because it works
<br>
<br>You will make mistakes but they won't be the end of everything.
<br>Let yoursek´lf do mistakes, it's gonna be ok
<br>
<br>Thank you for spending a day with me I completely enjoyed being here.
<br>
<br>---
<br>What's important to you.Everybody has a goal - something from future, if they won't get it, they are ruined. Read what's on their cards.
<br>I will let you react. Open trust: -Here'swhats important to me. You gotta tell me what you need me to tell what you need to make the deal.
<br>Listen to the answer. You lose if you don't and think of your next move regardless the answer.
<br>--
<br>Open up to show cards - we never know how our cards overlap without opening them up - that requires trust.
<br>
<br>Start with baseline (jednoduché otázky, na ktoré povie pravdu - čo si mal na raňajky, koľko máš detí) jump to tough one - what's important for you
<br>People start lying, look down - signs of discomfort - "seems something is bothering you"
<br>--
<br>Sometimes it's in your interest to show what's in your cards. You may get a better deal than you wanted
<br>--
<br>If I take you 5 dollars, it will hurt you 2x more than delight if I gave you 10
<br>--
<br>Goal of negotiation is not today YES, but THA TS RIGHT.  Not you're right
<br>
<br>People yell because they are not heard
<br>
<br>Ask people who know how to do, go to do and do it. It sounds stupid
<br>
<br>If you get people to say some littleYes, they are more likely to say a big Yes
<br>Every question has impact. Every time you get someone say yes you create anxiety in that person
<br>--sounds stupid, but get the we m to say no
<br>-- cold calling: can I speak with you? Do you want to make more money? -> get to say 3 yes and then lunch with your main call (ask for money,...)
<br>NO script - 25 percent higher success rate: get to say 3 no. Have you given up visiting The White House? Vs Have you been to the WH?
<br>
<br>Little yes (do you have a few mins to talk - how long?)is a trap - never ever do - opposite happens
<br>Do you want an author to come to your show? How many people are approaching by trying to say yes
<br>Tell: *is it a ridiculous idea if you come and speak to* (add value, subject) course?
<br>*Do you want me to fail?*
<br>
<br>Ronald Reagan: next week you gonna go to voting booth. (Draw a picture - get attention by telling what they're facing)
<br>Are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier Togo to store and buy things than it was r years ago? Are we stronger than we were 4 years ago?
<br>If you answered yes, your choice is clear
<br>If you don't agree. If you don't agree this course we've been on is what you would yould like to see us for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice you have
<br>(He was other choice vs Jimmy Carter)
<br>
<br>
<br>There is a chanceyoudont remember me. I will show you I remember youwell - hey Steve, how's life, how are kids doing Steve. Steve Steve Steve...
<br>I want them to be successful
<br>Send them emal - have you given up on doing business with me? Must replying three mins
<br>
<br>
<br>Guy leaving voicemails
<br>Youcannot getadeal ok f you don't let them to know you
<br>
<br>If I only talked and you listened, I would be wasting your time.  Why would I do that
<br>
<br>Be calm, relaxed, don't rush. Most sales people want to be done quickly
<br>That why smiles and makes more deals than I do -> these things are learned
<br>Patience makes other side less pushed
<br>It's like silence effective pauses - a weapon - the more patient you are the more order person feels their autonomy is respected, easier to respond to you
<br>"We're gonna delay things in order to save time"
<br>People who are direct and action oriented (boss asks when will we get it done) need twice long to get things done as guys who are relaxed
<br>Atlanta 3 hr, Portland 8hr
<br>
<br>We make decisions based on what we care about - that makes decisions emotional
<br>> Negatives are 3 times more powerful than positives
<br>
<br>I want them to build trust to open up,if there's some bad news I will tell them
<br>Build trust - show knowledge- you know something about market
<br>Predictability is important - I don't want surprises
<br>
<br>
<br>It's big thing if you look at all at once. You need to break it down
<br>-i will let that person talk andparaphrase all they say - counterintuitive tactics to avoid getting into habit
<br>
<br>If you say so you think the deal won't work
<br>I'd look why you think it won't work - i would look for hesitation
<br>If someone gives you hesitation (okaaaay....) They are waiting to pick it up from there
<br>
<br>You,re right is Sam as Fuck you
<br>You want them to stop talking
<br>
<br>Resume correlates losly with weather you do the job or not
<br>When you're asked how are you gonna help, don't tell your resume - it's a mistake (FBI expert, author of books, government trustee)
<br>-tell youreknowledgeable about their problem. You have lessthan10 seconds. Show them what they are looking at. Show them you are able to find solutions they need
<br>
<br>
<br>---

<br>
<br>Handling unreasonable request. Anywhere.
<br>We have your son
<br>-How am I supposed to give you 1M dollars?
<br>-I’m sorry Robert, how do I even know hes even alive?
<br>——employ most potent tool: open ended question
<br>——sorry, fname: make conversation warmer, make them to solve your problems
<br>4
<br>
<br>Intellectual superiority: wear khakis with relaxed confidence
<br>
<br>A lucky one-off was one thing. But this time it was pattern
<br>
<br>Those guys were smart, but they were playing the same game with the same rules. I had skills they didnt
<br>
<br>Ask  same 4 open ended questions over and over. They get worn out and tell you what you need. Sounds like saying no until they fall apart
<br>7
<br>
<br>Negotiation therries - all in rational frames (do a,b,c, get d)
<br>People are impulsive emotional animals, negotiation is unpredictable
<br>
<br>Framing effect - people respond differently  to the same choice depending how its framed (greater value in moving from 90 to 100 than from 45 to 55)
<br>Loss aversion - people statistically more likely act to avert a loss than achieve equal gain
<br>
<br>System 1 - animal mind, fast, instinctive, emotional
<br>System 2 - slow, logical
<br>System 1 mire influential, steers our rational thoughts
<br>-we react emotionally S1 to questions or suggestions. Then S1 reaction creates S2 answer (spring that feeds river)
<br>-Affect counterparts thinking by how you frame questions and statements, then you can guide his rationality S2 and modify responses
<br>-How am i supposed to do that? -> influence S1 that offer is not good enough, S2 will rationalise situation and gives you better offer
<br>13

<br>
<br>Cognitive bias - brain process that dissorts way we see the world
<br>
<br>Getting to say Yes, doesnt work for complex negotiations (how would you divise a mutual win-win with someone who think is a messiah)?
<br>—rational thinking
<br>—negotiate in dymamic, intense, uncertain environment, emotional crisis and no clwar demands?
<br>
<br>Developing positive relationships
<br>Listening is the cheapest, yet the most effective confession
<br>By listening intensely, you demonstrate empathy and shows sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
<br>16

<br>
<br>Negotiation - information gsthering and behavior influencing
<br>-nothing more than communication with results
<br>-its a collaboration, it can make confluct productive for all parties
<br>17
<br>
<br>-Negotiation starts sith No - get them to say no
<br>-Eliminate Yes/No questions to force them to solve your problems
<br>-Discover importance of nonverbal communication: how to use How to gently say No, how to get counterparts bid against themselves
<br>20
<br>
<br>Myself - hardworkimg, willing to learn, but not particularly talented
<br>I knew life holds amazing possibilities, didnt know how to unlock them.
<br>With skolls I have learned, i found myself doing extraordinary things and watching people i have taught achieve life changing results
<br>When I use what i learned over past 30 years i have power to change where the course of my life is going

<br>
<br>Too often people find it easier to stick with what they believe. Using biases and assumptions they mock up their version of the world - unchanging amd often flawed
<br>Great players are able to question assuptioms that the rest accepts on faith or in ignorance, and thus remain more emotionally open and intellectually agile to all possibilities and fluid situation
<br>25
<br>####
<br>
<br>Use of personal pronouns - we, they vs me, I - the less important you make yourself, the more important you probably are
<br>26
<br>
<br>Spoke with a voice of complete calm and absolute confidence
<br>
<br>Everything we assumed we knew was wrong
<br>
<br>We are easily distracted - we engage in selective listening, hearing on what we want to hear, our minds act on cognitive bias for considtency rather than truth
<br>27
<br>
<br>We can process only about 7 pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment
<br>George Miller
<br>28
<br>
<br>In discussion people tent to listen voices in their heads. Instead of prioritising your argument, disarm counterpart by listening - focus on what what they want to say. You will make them feel safe
<br>Then identify their need (monetarily, emotionally,...) and get them feel safe enough - then they will talk about what they want - wants are easy to talk about, cost you nothing, representing aspiration, sustain illusion of control and show vulnerability.
<br>—
<br>Listen, validate emotions, create trust and and safety for real conversation
<br>28
<br>##
<br>
<br>Slow it down
<br>Problem was we were so much in hurry, , driving too hard toward quick solutions, tryimg to be people solver, not a people mover.

<br>
<br>Late night DJ voice
<br>Joe’s gone. Now you are talking to me.
<br>Deal done
<br>No alternative goven that would beg further discussion
<br>You van be very direct to the point as long as you create safety by tone (low and deep) of voice.
<br>34
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-Repeat last or most critical 3 words
<br>You chased my driver away
<br>We chased your driver away?
<br>Unconscious response - building trust, bonding - speech, tone, body language patterns
<br>We fear of whats different and draw to whats similar
<br>-Trigger to make counterpart elaborate and sustain comnection
<br>36
<br>
<br>Totally outrged
<br>He responded like a pitbull backed into a corner. Called Dominick a liar.
<br>Dominick kept his cool - it brought guy from boil to simmer
<br>
<br>Mirroring
<br>-only weapon When need to deal with aggressive, impulsive person in position of authority
<br>-When person’s voice is incosistent with words
<br>1 late night FM DJ voice - use selectively to make a point - keep calm and slow - create authority
<br>2 Start with Im sorry (shows respect and concern)
<br>3 mirror and silence
<br>4 repeat
<br>—
<br>Lets do two copies. Im dorry, two copies? (Help me understand)
<br>You can store it anywhere. Anywhere?
<br>45
<br>
<br>Negotiation os not a battle of arguments (listening own voice). Its a discovery
<br>
<br>Think of oprah - taking to people she never met, in front of millions getting them to open up
<br>Smile to ease tension, subtle verbal and non verbal communication to signal empathy and thus security, embrace specific kind of question and avoid others
<br>
<br>—-
<br>Dont feel their pain, label it
<br>—-
<br>
<br>Emotions have been seen as an obstacle to good outcome. Separate people from problem, they said
<br>Emotions are their problem - fears, delights
<br>49
<br>#
<br>
<br>Instead of deniying emotions, good negotiator identifies and influences them.
<br>50
<br>#
<br>
<br>Imagine yourself in their place
<br>-it looks you dont want to come out. It looks like you dont want to go to jail
<br>
<br>Ignoring other person’s position builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do what you want
<br>
<br>Agreeing is sympathy
<br>
<br>Tactical empathy - seeing from another persons point of view while they are talking to them and assess whats driving them
<br>
<br>Best officers know if they empathize, they can talk to their audiences
<br>52
<br>
<br>Closely observe persons face, gestures, tone of voice and our brainaligns with them. Neural resonance
<br>
<br>Labelling
<br>Once you spot emotion, label it aloud. Give neutral star.ent
<br>It sounds like...
<br>It seems like...
<br>It looks like...
<br>++go silent
<br>-disagreements are okay, say it didnt say that. It just looks like that
<br>#
<br>56
<br>
<br>Try it out - label on of the persons emotions in any conversation and see the change
<br>
<br>Grumpy grandfather
<br>He’s grumpy because he never sees his family and feels keft out
<br>Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior address his sadness in non judgemental way. Head off his cincern before you start
<br>Notice how it acknowledges situation and labels saddness
<br>-We dont see each other that often
<br>-It seems you feel like we dont pay enough attention to you
<br>59
<br>
<br>Research shows to deal with negativity without reaction and judgement. Then label each negative feeling and replace with more positive, compassionate and constructive thought
<br>59
<br>#
<br>
<br>-I want to inform you,....
<br>Stupidly aggressive, *impersonal*, tone deaff communication default for the most businesses
<br>No acknowledgement on their situation
<br>No empathy, no connection, just give me money
<br>60
<br>
<br>Rewrite the script, no massive changes, no discounts
<br>Build deep emotional resonance,
<br>Acknowledge not only their but yours debt as well
<br>-Now its YOUR team, purpose of the call is to ensure that the most valuable fans would be at the season opener
<br>-in these difficult times our fans have been hit hard, asked to talk back thiuugh their Unique situation
<br>61##
<br>
<br>The faster you remove obstacles, the quicker you generate feelings of safety, wellbeing, and trust
<br>
<br>Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer

<br>Don't be demoralised if process goes slowly
<br>
<br>Showing projects to potential donor.
<br>Shook head above each.
<br>-hold your emotions
<br>-i can see some hesitation with these project //say in low voice
<br>...
<br>//could focus conversation, but difficult Donor still not interested, can sense growing frustration
<br>-it seems you are very passionate about your gift and want to find right project reflecting opportunities you received
<br>Signed a check without picking project - you understand me, I trust you can find the right one 
<br>-- she had fear that her money would be misappropriated -- first question uncovered that - obstacle wasn't finding right match, obstacle was she needed to understand why she

<br>When I ask class for volunteering they are all shy.
<br>I say "for those of you interesting in volunteering in front of class, I want to tell you in advance -it's gonna be horrible. And those who volunteer will get more out of that than anybody else"
<br>-- I labeled audience's fears - how much can be soˇeyhing worse than horrible?
<br>#
<br>
<br>We start criticism "I don't want to sound harsh, I don't want to be an asshole" - this denies negative
<br>-list out every negative thing counterpart would think and say it
<br>###
<br>-disarm counterpart while negotiating everything from son's bedtime to business
<br>-defense lawyers in court mention all weaknesses and everything their client is accused of in their opening statement - take the sting out
<br>(This is not a good situation and we appreciate the fact you are acknowledging what happens, we don't think you are mistreating us)
<br>-creates safe zone for empathy
<br>
<br>Use the same method to acknowledge experience
<br>
<br>You need to instrument different techniques
<br>Labelling: previous customers seemed upset, seems this is a hectic time for you -acknowledge her situation, I hear you, build relationship.
<br>Labels,empathy, request (use information you received): you are handling this pretty well. I also missed my flight. Flight seems to be full, but as you said, someone might miss due to weather. Is there possibility any seat will be open?
<br>-ackniwledging situation work, if there is upset customer, take it to your advantage
<br>
<br>Empathy - it pleases us to feel listened and acknowledged
<br>##
<br>Create empathetic connection and encourage counterpart to expand on their situation - these tools will help you create warm relationships
<br>Practice. May feel awkward at first
<br>72#
<br>
<br>Once they know you are listening, they may tell you something you can use
<br>
<br>-reasons for No may be more powerful than them. Make sure you remove barriers for clear communication
<br>-pause. After you label barriers. Let them fill the silence
<br>-you are dealing with person who wants to be appreciated a d undersood. Reinforce positive perceptions
<br>
<br>Many try to keep staying with Yes flow - no is a death to discussion. Shared interest cannot be found
<br>But yes is meaninglessness hides deeper objections. 
<br>Maybe even worse
<br>Saying yes makes you uncomfortable, No is a pure relief
<br>-
<br>No is pure gold for good negotiators
<br>Opportunity to clarify what you really want
<br>No maintains status quo, provides control
<br>##
<br>When you come to realize the real psychological dynamic behind it, you’ll love the word. It’s not just that you lose your fear of it, but that you come to learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out of it. 
<br>
<br>Success hostage negotiation
<br>Penetrate takers motives, state of mind, intelligence, emotional strengths and weaknesses 
<br>
<br>No
<br>No
<br>No
<br>Come on. There has to be something I can do.
<br>-see power of certain words. 
<br>-no's were clear and direct. A gateway to final yes
<br>
<br>"No" is rarely a final answer. Think of negotiations with a kid.
<br>We conditioned ourdelves to fear of that
<br>Say it to protect yourself (status quo) and consider possibilities
<br>
<br>You preserve people's authonomy by No.
<br>Hostage taker - start talking instead of demanding to surrender. Will finish quicker
<br>
<br>NO means
<br>-not ready to agree
<br>-you make me feel uncomfortable
<br>-i don't understand, can't afford
<br>-want something else
<br>-need more info
<br>#
<br>
<br>After no: "what about that doesn't work for you? What would you need to make it work? It seems there is something that bothers you"
<br>#
<br>
<br>YES types
<br>Counterfeit - easier escape route
<br>Commitment - yes you want to hear, let's sign contract
<br>
<br>Your job is not to get them say small yes
<br>But to get them discover their goal as their own
<br>
<br>Creating connection is useful but is useless unless they feel they are equally (or solely) responsible for connection and the new ideas
<br>
<br>We cannot control others decisions
<br>But we can influence them by seeing and hearing exactly what they want. Entering their mental world
<br>#
<br>
<br>-primary urges: need feeling of safety and control
<br>(You cannot logically convince they are safe) - being nice is unsuccessful (sympathy)
<br>
<br>We live in an age which celebrates niceness under various names
<br>
<br>Yes is sign of defense"do you have a minute to talk?" > "Is it a bad time to talk now?"
<br>No tells you counterpart is engaged and thinking
<br>#
<br>
<br>No can push to decision making zone.
<br>Many think No means end of discussion. Use it strategically and it opens path forward
<br>
<br>Say no and you will see opportunitities you didn't previously.
<br>No often Spurs people to action. They thought they protected themselves and it's time to slip away
<br>
<br>Political fundraising
<br>-dont you think gas prices are high? Is obama responsible for that? Can I have your card number to make a change?
<br>VS
<br>-if things stay the same do you think the best days are ahead of us? Are you going to sit and do nothing? If you want to do something today you can donate to x
<br>-wants put you to in-charge position
<br>-notoce how NOs are swapped by Yes
<br>
<br>Every no gets me closer to yes
<br>
<br>MISLABEL
<br>Technique to get their prompt response
<br>Use wrong label even if you know it's wrong, that forces them to correct you
<br>-sounds it seems you are eager to leave this job
<br>-if you are not interested, I understand
<br>###
<br>CS
<br>
<br>If you are feared of No. You cannot negotiate
<br>
<br>Get them to say No to become comfortable to move forward.
<br>Force to say no
<br>-"lets talk about what you don't want"
<br>-"ok, what you would say no to"
<br>##
<br>
<br>3rd Follow-up - one sentence email
<br>-"Have you given up on this project?"
<br>##
<br>Request to define their position and explain to you
<br>You give threat you will walk away with your terms
<br>
<br>As a parent you say: ok, I am leaving.
<br>Apply to the business as well - may sound rude, get over it. Ignoring you is what's rude
<br>
<br>Sounds contrary, but you cannot get them feel safe and in control by being nice. Need to get them draw boundaries by saying no.
<br>Yes doesnt tell their true feelings
<br>
<br>Negotiation is about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you.
<br>
<br>Psychology - Carl Rogerd - change can only come if therapist accepts client as he or she is
<br>
<br>-we developed habit of hiding who we are, what we think and instead seek approval
<br>
<br>Give them label with confidence (unverified)
<br>To get them open their position
<br>"You hate them, do you?"
<br>--
<br>-give feelings names and identify how they feel
<br>#
<br>
<br>I didn't know what it was going to give us. I knew we had to trust the process
<br>
<br>1.Silence - use for emphasis, get them keep talking until emotions are drained from dialogue
<br>2.Minimal encouragements - yes, ok, I see - shows you listen
<br>--
<br>3.Mirroring - rather than argue, repeat what they say
<br>##
<br>
<br>4.Paraphrase - repeat in your own words. Shows you understand
<br>5.summarize - repeat and acknowledge emotions
<br>
<br>Mirror, encourage, label - repeat and gets them soften
<br>
<br>Get them to say Thats right
<br>-you need to show empathy, get trust, reflect on their vision
<br>-works on hostage negotiations (not talking about ransom any more) and business
<br>
<br>Label true root cause(football)
<br>-You think it's not masculine.
<br>-You think it's cowardly to get out
<br>
<br>Put onderstandong of their needs to work for you
<br>-dont talk about benefits of your product, talk about thier work. Start with things they are passionate about
<br>--last time we spoke about your patients. I remember you seemed very passionate about treating them and tailoring treatment. You seem to have deep understanding... summarize, discuss challenges - understand how your product fits, build trust
<br>You tailor for each patient, reflect on challenges
<br>
<br>Negotiation is never a linear formula
<br>Do X, get Y - the only way to achieve Y
<br>Pay this amount of money, get this
<br>Understand the world of unspoken needs and thoughts, you can change their needs and expectations(eg people's fear of deadlines).
<br>There are always ways to bend their reality to conform what you want, not what they thought they deserve.
<br>#
<br>
<br>Compromise won't work for someone with win-lose approch
<br>Don't settle with compromise - it's a bad deal and no deal is often better then bad deal
<br>(BlowimgNose - compromise of patched A and B worse than A or B)
<br>-
<br>We do compromises because it's easy and saves us face. Most people are driven by fear of causing pain.
<br>-
<br>Creative solutions are harder, cause risk and conflict. Great deals are made of hard stuff. Embrace the hard stuff. That's what great negotiators do
<br>#
<br>
<br>Set deadlines - real or fictional - to create pressure - deal now is better than good deal. 
<br>Deadlines - Get people say things impulsively against their interests (loss, consequences)
<br>
<br>Deadlines are always flexible and arbitrary, hardly trigger consequences
<br>
<br>More ambiguous threat (answered What, When, Why, How), less serious
<br>
<br>Understand their motivation
<br>-kidnapper wants random by Friday because wants to party
<br>-car dealer may accept a better price by the end of the month when transactions are assessed and needstohit his targets.
<br>
<br>Advice from great negotiators
<br>-keep your deadlines in secret? No, use it to your advantage. They many put you under pressure, but you may give them no deal
<br>-use your deadline to create pressure on them. Deadlines are never arbitrary
<br>#
<br>
<br>If you create your startegy on assumption the other guy thinks like you, it's not empathy, it's projection
<br>###
<br>
<br>Have 10 dollars, negotiate with counterpart fair split. If turns down you offer, I take my dollars back
<br>-the most rational offer is to give 1 dollar - logically unrejetable - 1 is always better than 0
<br>-any other deal is an emotional offer
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>That's ok.
<br>Why we use logic to reason, our decisions are actually governed by emotions
<br>--
<br>People with damage of part of brain that generates emotions cannot make even simplest decisions, however they can describe what they should do in logical terms
<br>
<br>Ultimatum game- most people reject unfair offers.
<br>Negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs monetary gains
<br>
<br>People, companies and countries do that - to reject perceived unfairness
<br>
<br>Take advantage - say "We just want what's fair"
<br>-get better price offer, - takes counterpart to defence
<br>-"We have given you a fair offer" - aggressively shift focus on counterparts lack of understanding of fairness
<br>-"Fair? It seems you are ready to provide evidence to support that"
<br>##
<br>
<br>Set stage for empathy
<br>"I want to treat you fairly at all the times. Stop me when you feel you are treated unfairly" -gets them honest and builds your good reputation
<br>
<br>Know emotional drivers and frame  benefits in language that resonates
<br>-babysitter sells calm evening, locksmith security, estate agent cozy living
<br>
<br>See mental patterns and you will be able to influence them.
<br>You can see them in irrational decisions
<br>Value is what we perceive --if I sell you a coffee mug worth of 1usd for 5, you would resell for 7. Deal for 10 would have less value than potential deal for 20 instead.
<br>
<br>Find more on 
<br>prospect theory-how people choose between options that involve risk and negotiation. 
<br>-
<br>Certainty Effect - People are drawn to sure things even when probability is a Better choice
<br>#
<br>
<br>Loss Aversion - People will take risks to avoid losses than achieve same gains (why people buy insurance they don't need)
<br>^^
<br>To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

<br>NEEED to change perception of value
<br>Needed to tell contractor that I can only pay 500 instead of 2000

<br>//Now the call is not about 2000, but not losing 500 to some other guide

<br>
<br>Domt screw up your price negotiation (salary) by going first
<br>-its normal that err were have perfect info and know little about the market to open with confidence
<br>
<br>GIVE RANGE
<br>Instead of saying I am worth of 110k say At places like X people get 130-170
<br>-albeit the best possible ballpark you wish to be in
<br>-gets them thinking in higher levels
<br>-when asked on salary, give range - more likely to get more
<br>-domt stop there, make sure you negotiated terms for your next raise
<br>###
<br>
<br>Pivot to nonmonetary values
<br>They ask you How much. Numbers in isolation lead to bargaining
<br>If you anchored high, Offer them things that are not important to you but may be important to them. If their offer is low, ask for things important to them
<br>
<br>ˇ-when asked How much? Move focus to non-financial issues
<br>Talk about your value - sell yourself more than workforce. Offer leadership
<br>Ask "What does it take to be successful here?"
<br>#
<br>-asked for guidance, they will watch how you follow advice
<br>Make a their personal stake in your success
<br>-you need to be good in labeling their emotions for that and empathising
<br>
<br>Use odd numbers - seem more fixed. Give weight of thoughtful ca´culation
<br>Zeros look like placeholders
<br>Decimal nuˇbers seem as calculated
<br>Give range as 113.5-125
<br>Get your number - don't say yes. Keep taking and create empathy
<br>#
<br>
<br>
<br>Use reciprocity
<br>When they reject your proposal, offer a generous surprise gift
<br>
<br>Bend reality
<br>-anchor their starting point. Tell how bad it would be
<br>Get them see what they would lose rather presenting potential gain
<br>
<br>Negotiation is not a wrestling match to exhaust your opponent
<br>#
<br>
<br>Failures plant seeds for future succcess
<br>
<br>Best negotiation is to get your counterpart do the yworknfor you and suggest the best solution
<br>"WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE?"
<br>
<br>We failed because we wanted them to see things our way
<br>We failed because we feared of rejection if we asked on information we needed
<br>We asked close-ended questions: yes/no, I want you do X - rather tell what you need, the guy isn't following your orders, he thinks it's his idea - you ask them for help
<br>
<br>
<br>Try it no negotiate price at store: instead of what you need describe what you are looking for and ask for suggestions
<br>Give them co tell rather than create pressure
<br>"Price is a bit more than I budgeted..how am I supposed to do that?"
<br>#
<br>
<br>Unresolved imvoice
<br>-summarize situation, then ask How am I supposed to do that?
<br>Stay calm - they will see it as a problem to solve, not a threat
<br>-without accusing them of anything, get them understand your problem and push to solve
<br>--turm close ended question to open ended
<br>#
<br>
<br>Softening words
<br>Perhaps
<br>Maybe
<br>It seems
<br>I think
<br>-takes out aggression from your statement
<br>
<br>Focus on WHAT and HOW
<br>Sometimes WHY
<br>Nothing else. WHO, When, Where prompts to share fact without thinking
<br>WHY  backfired
<br>Can, Is, Are, Do lead to yesno questions
<br>
<br>Does this look like something you would like?
<br>>
<br>How does it look to you?
<br>#
<br>
<br>What about this does work for you?
<br>>
<br>What about this doesn't work for you?
<br>-to trigger useful info
<br>
<br>What is the biggest challenge to you?
<br>
<br>>What about this is important to you?
<br>How can I help to make it better for us?
<br>How would you like me to proceed?
<br>How can we solve this problem?
<br>What's the objective? What are we trying to accomplish?
<br>How am I supposed to do that?
<br>#
<br>
<br>You can't leave
<br>>
<br>I understand you are pissed off
<br>What do you hope to solve by leaving? (Guide toward solving the problem)
<br>
<br>Boss showing his power questioning previous approval
<br>-When you signed this, what did you have in mind?
<br>
<br>Self control
<br>-if you can't control your emotions how do you expect to influence emotions of someone else?
<br>
<br>That's right question > It seems my bill is not justified, not fair
<br>How does this bill violate our agreement?
<br>
<br>When you are verbally insulted, don't strike back - disarm opponent by calibrated question (open ended, what, how - or offer apology - you are right, that was a bit harsh)
<br>Calm down emotions - that's how solutions can be found
<br>
<br>Don't try to force your opponent to admit you are right. Aggressive confrontation . Don't confuse with constructive dialogue
<br>
<br>---
<br>HOW TO implement the agreement
<br>
<br>Tjˇhr business grew as tourists felt their obvious passion
<br>
<br>I wanted to employ lessons we learned
<br>I told my guys we have a new strategy
<br>
<br>To make it harder for rebels to kill - hostage impressed them with his knowledge of jungle anfˇd reached martial arts
<br>
<br>Answer each demand with question
<br>>How do I ...?
<br>I don't have that much money. How can I raise? Always questions...
<br>-answering questions gives them position of control
<br>-giide opponent to develop solution that works for you
<br>-you don't say No. You say How which accepts the demand and drills down - shows respect
<br>##
<br>
<br>>I would love to help. But how am I supposed to do that?
<br>
<br>People put more effort to implement solution if they t hink it's theird
<br>
<br>Assure implementatiomˇn
<br>>How do we assure we are on track?
<br>>What do we do if we find we are off track?
<br>Then summarize their answers until you get Thats right
<br>
<br>Warning sign they don't believe idea is theitˇrs
<br>FAˇake yes, you are right
<br>I'll try
<br>?investigate problem
<br>Get them tell their terms - keep asking how
<br>
<br>Consider oˇinterests of people not directly involved biˇut responsible for implementation
<br>
<br>>How does this affect rest of the team?
<br>What they see as main challenge?
<br>How aligned are they?
<br>How does this affect everybody else?
<br>
<br>Someone (a stakeholder) may kill the deal because may feel  their ego is hurt
<br>
<br>How can I is a polite way to say the offer is generous, bit doesn't work for me
<br>Deliver it in polite way to become a request for help
<br>You can say Im sorry to soften your No
<br>"I'm sorry Im afraid I just can't do that"
<br>
<br>When you say NO, use downward inflection and tone of regard- it's not meant to be "no!"
<br>
<br>Multistep NO
<br>Say NO for four times to get things changed - get them bid against themselves
<br>
<br>Treating JERKS - aggresivity
<br>-how do I, how can I? How am I supposed? - gives silent no
<br>-responding with defence,what and how questions
<br>
<br>7percemt of message comes from words.
<br>38 percent comes from tone of voice
<br>55 from body language 
<br>(UCLA)
<br>
<br>Pay close attention to words and presemtation - if don't align, suspect is probably lying or unconvinced
<br>-Sounds, are we agreed?
<br>-Yes...
<br>-You said yes, but there is hesitation
<br>-nah, it's necessary thing really
<br>-No, this is important, let's make sure we get this right
<br>#
<br>
<br>People who live try harder to be believed - use more words, more complex sentences
<br>
<br>Slicky sales people use your name to hammer you.
<br>Use your name or names of involved people - forces ampathy, humanizes objects
<br>
<br>I gravitate towards tense situations
<br>
<br>Introduce your name to get counterpart warmer
<br>-dont sit here
<br>-hey, my name is Chris, offer hand for handshake (may stop seing you as enemy - maybe guy is on low point and world is against him)
<br>
<br>Shop:
<br>-can I have discount?
<br>-no
<br>-my name is Chris... Explain your situation...
<br>Humanize yourself, use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in fun and friendly way.let tjem enjoy interaction

<br>
<br>Started huge argument and soured their relationship
<br>
<br>Strategy to build empathy
<br>-It seems...you are under pressure from wife..I understand ... It takes a lot froˇ you
<br>-list out all concerns..I know you think I ...don't care about costs and taking profits from company : be careless with spending 
<br>
<br>This price is very fair...
<br>Away to put off someone is implying that disagreeing you is unfair
<br>
<br>Demand from lawyer, reply with polite NO:
<br>/The price you offered is very fair, and I certainly wish that I could afford it. Bruno has worked very hard for this business, and he deserves to be compensated appropriately. I am very sorry, but wish you the best of luck./
<br>--
<br>/Thank you for your offer. You were generous to reduce the price, which I greatly appreciate. I really wish that I could pay you this amount, but I am sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this time. As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with that type of money. Again, I wish you the best of luck./
<br>-resist temptation to accept a better offer
<br>/Thank you again for the generous offer. You have really come down on the price and I have tried very hard to come up with that amount. Unfortunately, no one is willing to lend me the money, not even my mother. I have tried various avenues but cannot come up with the funding. In the end, I can offer you €23,567, although I can only pay €15,321.37 up front. I could pay you the remainder over a one-year period, but that is really the most I can do. I wish you the best in your decision./
<br>
<br>YES is nothing without HOW. To know how, ask HOW - gives them feeling control discussion
<br>Ask How can I do that - as subtle no that pushes them to look for other solutions
<br>
<br>A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you’re hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.
<br>
<br>36k. Give understanding nod and purse lips. In nicest way possible
<br>/“I can pay $30,000,” I said. “And I can pay it up front, all cash. I’ll write a check today for the full amount. I’m sorry, I’m afraid I just can’t pay any more.”/
<br>--I'm sorry, we can't do that. I hope you understand, we can figure out something with financing 36k
<br>--It's a beautiful truck. Really amazing. I can't tell you how much I want it and I *know its worth more than I am offering.* I'm sorry, this is embarrassing. *I can't do that price*
<br>34k
<br>This is very generous and it's the car of my dreams. I *really wish I could do that.* *I simply cant*
<br>32.5 - this is your win!
<br>I am so grateful. You have been generous and I can't thank you enough. Truck is worth more than my price. I aˇ sorry, just can't do that
<br>No smile, stood up, gone. We can do that. 30k
